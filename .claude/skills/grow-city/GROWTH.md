# Solvista growth ledger

Append-only log of `grow-city` iterations. Newest at the bottom. Each iteration =
one growth vector, verified by `census.mjs` (numeric, no-regression gate) + a
screenshot pass. This file is the loop's memory: rotate vectors, don't repeat.

Census matrix: seeds `[7, 42, 1234]` × eras `[1985, 2005, 2035]`, `t=0.35`.
Metrics are summed over all 9 cells of the matrix.

## State of the city (maintained header — UPDATE EACH ITERATION)

This grid + the notes below are what step 1 (Orient) reads instead of the whole
archive. Cells hold iteration numbers (**struck = explored and reverted**, so the
cell is *attempted*, not *filled* — read its entry before re-trying it); `U1`–`U5` are user-directed passes
(U1 generative monorail · U2 feedback polish: smooth water motion / hover
tooltip / kelp re-gate · U3 determinism audit · U4 hexagon plate + plural
rivers/monorails/cable cars · U5 census stats that can fall).

**Interaction/UX is now a column** (added iter 97). It was a documented *kind* that lived only in
the bullet below, so a domain touched by an Interaction vector still looked untouched to step 1's
rotation scan. Cells hold only vectors the ledger explicitly attributes to a domain; cross-cutting
ones (U2, 42, U5) stay in the bullet.

| Domain | New element | New CA rule | Deepen | Connect | Scale | Polish | Interaction/UX |

| **Transport** | 2, 9, 21, 31, 48, **164** | 77 | 28, 39, 55, 63, **112**, **121**, **128**, **155**, **179**, **193** | 5, 15, **138** | U4 | U1, U3, 70, 85, 87, 94, **146**, **188**, ~~**203**~~ | **105**, **171** |
| **Civic & culture** | 3, 11, 18, 30, **100** | 36, **107** | 36, 59, 66, 80, 91, **149**, **158**, **175**, ~~**195**~~ | 45, **204** | | 73, ~~**114**~~, **168** | 52, 122, **140**, **184** |

| **People & activity** | 41, 56, **127**, **170**, **186** | 49 | 34, 64, 93, **104**, **119**, **145**, **178**, **201** | 78, **111** | | 84, **137**, **163** | 71, **154**, **191** |

- **Interaction/UX kind:** tile tooltip (U2, user-directed) + **entity
  tooltips (iter 42)** + **Est./Built years in tooltips (iter 52, Civic-led)**
  + **hover focus ring (iter 71, People-led)** + **census stats that can fall
  (U5: tallest / density / solar share / transit reach / walkable)**
  + **the coast names itself (iter 97, Water-led: pier/stall/ferris wheel,
  esplanade, lifeguard tower, dune `Sand`+`Marram grass`, live `Tide`)**
  + **the transit lines name themselves (iter 105, Transport-led: hovering a monorail train or
  cable-car cabin names its LINE — "Line 3 of 3 — a 183-span loop with 30 stations" — and traces the
  whole route across the city, pipped at its stops)**
  + **the woods name their own stand (iter 117, Nature-led: `Stand — N hexes` by live flood fill,
  `Canopy Closed/Thickening/Open edge` read from the draw's own `k`, `Undisturbed ~N yr`,
  `Old growth since`, `Deep woods`, `Mushrooms up`, `Burning`, and a live
  `Wildflowers In bloom/Gone over/Not in flower`)**
  + **the institutions name themselves (iter 122, Civic-led: `CIVICDESC` gives all 12 kinds their own
  sentence, drawn from each one's siting rule; `Civic quarter — N institutions` by `siteQuarter`'s own
  `MAJORK`/`QFAR`; `Fronts a paved forecourt` / `Keeps its own grounds behind`, and the squares answer
  back with `Forecourt of — Town hall` / `Grounds of — Museum`; `One of — 4 schools`)**.
  When adding an entity array: `stamp()` it in its draw + add an `ENTINFO` row
  (same discipline as the census hook). `stamp()` now also draws the focus ring,
  so any stamped entity is ringable for free — **and since iter 133 a hovered TILE is ringed too (cue l closed)**.
  **An `ENTINFO` `sub` may be a
  FUNCTION of the entity (iter 105)** — use it when a thing's interest is its
  *membership* (which line / route / depot), computed live, not a stored string.
- **ROTATION.** Last vector per domain:
  Sky **200** · People **201** · Transport **203** · Urban **199** · Nature **206** · Civic **204** · Water **205**.
  **ITERATION 207 IS THE MANDATED STEP-BACK.** After it, the lap owes Urban (199), then Sky (200), then People (201).
  **206 took Nature × NEW CA RULE (the audit kind — 107's move) and FIXED a rule that had under-fired for the
  artifact's whole life.** The header's own banked cue said *"GARDEN is the last season-mute tile — Deepen it"*; one
  census read said **GARDEN = 6 hexes in the whole 9-cell matrix** (year-gated 2008+, so ~2/city at 2035, zero
  elsewhere) and **seed 5 grew ZERO gardens, ever.** The rule wanted `RES` with **>=3 RES neighbours** — and **a house
  ringed by houses is the house the upgrade pass turns into a mid-rise**, so its pool **collapsed 40 -> 15 across the
  only years it was allowed to run** (`probe-gardenhost`): **`T.MARKET`'s defect one tile over.** Fix: **`RES` is the
  wrong definition of *home* — a mid-rise is still housing.** Shared **`HOMES={RES,MID}`** (TOWER excluded: skyline,
  not neighbourhood) ⇒ pool **2.5x and STABLE**, seed 5's host **3 -> 30**, **`GARDEN 6 -> 17`**, core flat. The probe
  also **killed the obvious next idea before a line was written**: the rule's comment says *"between the houses"*, but
  the **vacant lot** is a mirage (`EMPTY` with >=2 RES nbrs falls **85 -> 6.5** by 2035, **0.0** with a road adjacent
  — development eats every gap).
  **⚠ 206's SECOND find, and the one with legs: A GARDEN IN AMONG THE HOMES IS OFTEN INVISIBLE.** The seed-5 visual
  agent FAILed — **and was RIGHT** (3rd time in 7 laps, after 200's sun and 205's ship), though not for its stated
  reason. `probe-gardenvis` (203's z-order rig): the camera was aimed **true** (centroid 17px on an 88px hex) and
  seed 5's garden rendered **0 px of ink against 8,924 px drawn on top — 100% occluded**; across 23 gardens, **mean
  58% occluded, 7 of 23 >=86% buried.** Draw order IS depth order, and **the homes you site among are what bury you.**
  I had stated the claim in **cells** when it was a claim about **what the eye sees** (205's law, cashed against me one
  lap later). Ships as a **light PREFERENCE, not a gate** — `rng()<(openFront?0.075:0.02)` ⇒ mean occluded **58% ->
  40%**, fully-invisible **1 -> 0**, >=86% buried **7/23 -> 1/24**, no seed left at zero. **⚠ The HARD gate STARVED it
  (`GARDEN 14 -> 5`, worse than the bug): `MID` is *both* a home *and* the thing that buries you, so the two predicates
  fight.** New law ⇒ SKILL.md: **a lever has TWO ledgers — measure its cost to the POPULATION, not just its effect on
  the INSTANCE.** **Reusable: `openFront(x,y)`+`TALLT`** (by `countAround`) — *is the hex in front clear?* **Any
  ground-level thing that must be SEEN should ask before siting itself; 204's buried service bays (cue n) are this
  same defect one domain over**, now half-answered: the density is not escapable by *choice of hex*, but it IS
  steerable by *weighting the roll*.
  **⚠ GARDEN's seasonal cue is now UNBLOCKED and worth cashing** (see the mute-tile bullet): its draw still reads no
  `year` at all — the last season-mute vegetation tile — and it *finally has a host to show it on*.
  **204 took Civic × CONNECT and SHIPPED: the service fleet comes home** — three CIVICDESC lines parked a vehicle at
  a door (precinct yard, the hospital's *"ambulance bay that never closes"*, the firehouse's roll-up doors) while
  `stepVehicle` random-walked all three like a car, so **not one ever went home**; each now runs a round trip routed
  by a BFS field over ROAD cells. Law (*a stubbed shared `Math.random` makes a PER-ENTITY control worthless — make
  the control a POPULATION*) ⇒ SKILL.md. Full recap: its own Iteration 204 entry, still in window.
  **⚠ 204's REAL find is that the FIRE CA IS A GHOST — do not build "X answers the fire" (`probe-firehost`).**
  Ignition is year-gated (blocks `year<2006`, forest `year<2030`), so **at 2035 nothing can ignite at all**, and
  even before then it is vanishingly rare: across **3 seeds x 61 years** there are **TWO one-cell episodes** in
  the engine's whole era (seeds 7 and 1234: *zero*), and fire **never spreads** (peak 1.00 cells lit). A cell
  burns 4 ticks = **1.8 real seconds** while the engine covers **1.6 hexes**. So the engine now *heads* to the
  smoke the moment one lights (forced-fire probe: road-distance descends **56->7 / 42->0 / 66->6** monotone on 3
  seeds, HEAD wanders) and usually never arrives — which is the model being honest, not a bug. **The fire system
  is `T.MARKET` all over again: fully drawn, three labels boasting about it, and it never runs.** Reviving it is
  a Nature/Urban CA lap with a real cost (BURNT is the darkest tile in the palette), not a freebie.
  **⚠ Banked cue (n) — A PARKED VEHICLE IS OFTEN INVISIBLE, AND THE DOOR IS NOT THE REASON.** `probe-servbay`
  measures the parked vehicle's ink against itself re-drawn on top: **4 of 9 read 0%** — eaten whole by whatever
  tall thing stands in the rows in front (draw order IS depth order). 204 then built a door-ranking lever and
  **measured it at nothing**: nearest / least-blocked-3-rows / strictly-in-front score **485 / 489 / 485 out of
  900**. What buries a bay is the **density of the downtown its institution stands in** — the police station
  happens to sit in the open and reads 91-99% on every seed; the hospital and firehouse are in the core. No
  choice among four road hexes escapes it. **Making a bay legible means giving the CIVIC TILE a visible apron on
  its front edge — a `polish-tile` job, not a growth lap** (same shape as 195's university light). The lever was
  measured before it was mandated (198's law) and is NOT in the shipped code.
  **205 took Water × CONNECT (the coldest cell, last used at 22) and EXPLORED → REVERTED. Its finding is the BIG
  one and is held in full by cue (o) below: THE PORT HAS NO WATERFRONT — Solvista is a ROADSTEAD, not a harbour,**
  so the anchored freighter (comment: *"waiting on a berth"*; tooltip: *"Serving the harbor works"*; and
  `if(f.anchored)continue`) is a perfect-looking label-tell that is **NOT a defect** — a roadstead is an open
  anchorage where ships lie at anchor precisely BECAUSE there is nowhere to come alongside. 205 built her the round
  trip, PASSED its own probe, and **two visual agents FAILed it on two seeds and were RIGHT** — the probe's
  `ALONGSIDE < 2.2 cells` threshold was a number chosen because the berth constant met it. Two laws ⇒ SKILL.md
  (*a probe whose threshold is in the units of your own design constant is grading your own homework*; *check the
  host exists before you believe the tell*). Full recap rotated to `GROWTH-archive.md` at 206.
  **203/201/202 — recaps rotated to `GROWTH-archive.md` at 206; laws promoted to SKILL.md. What survives: (a) THE
  WHOLE TRAMWAY IS SUB-PIXEL AT FIT ZOOM** (0.5px rope, 5px cabins, hairline masts) — 203 proved the rope properly
  depth-sorted (`probe-gondz`: 8.4-23.6% occluded) and the artifact INNOCENT of 202's "thin dark line"; the fault is
  LEGIBILITY ⇒ a **`polish-tile` job on the WHOLE tramway**, never a tweak to the rope. **Do NOT re-try: a body/halo
  under it (measured — backfires) or a lit top edge (measured — impossible at 0.5px). (b) 202 (20th step-back): CLEAN
  BILL on the city, the INSTRUMENT was broken** — perf compounds beneath the per-lap gate ⇒ **PERF**; the step-back
  camera was lying ⇒ **SKILL.md** + `probes/shot-stepback.mjs`.
  (Per-lap recaps of **196/198/199/200** rotated to `GROWTH-archive.md` at 206 — their laws are live elsewhere:
  198's *measure a lever before you mandate it* + the **PER-ELLIPSE cost model**, 199's *the tell's next host is a
  CONSTANT* + *inert-regime noise floor* ⇒ SKILL.md + **PERF**; 200's *probes are blind to the HUD* ⇒ its bullet
  below; 196's *a state-response diff needs a POSITIVE control* ⇒ SKILL.md.)
  **195 (Civic × Deepen, REVERTED). STILL-UNCASHED: `university` is the ONLY of the twelve civics with no `LITAMT`
  — the only `MAJORK` monument pitch dark after sunset; every place to put the light failed ⇒ a `polish-tile` job,
  not a growth lap** (gate kept: `probes/probe-unilight.mjs` + `shot-uni.mjs`).
  **Sky is post-saturation (Deepen/Fix ONLY — its additive/CA cells are traps).** **Urban is measured-saturated: additive spent (118), and Connect measured-hard TWICE** — 160 (RES terracing: no seed forms E-W RES runs of >=3) and 165 (high-street arcade: the `hstr` parade zigzags with row parity, longest straight-hex-axis run = 2, so it is not a clean arcade host); **Urban's next lap is Deepen/Polish only** (or a COM arcade if a *straight-hex-axis* retail run is ever found — the parade is not one). **Roof-furniture is CLOSED city-wide** across all 5 developed types (MID/RES water tanks, TOWER gardens, COM plant 165, IND warehouse north-light clerestory 173) — no bare roof is left, so a future Urban "bare roof" vector has no host; Urban Deepen must go elsewhere (facades, ground plane, harbour apron). (The per-lap recaps of **173-185**, and their superseded "next lap owes" pointers, were rotated into `GROWTH-archive.md` at iter 196 to pay for 196's lines — the header is a fixed budget, and the ROTATION line above is the live pointer.) Check the last entry of the stalest domain for a banked
  finding before reading its row. (**137 took People × Polish**: gave the walking figures — peds/dogs/joggers,
  the only movers with no `shadS()` shadow while every vehicle has one — the house-style contact shadow at the
  feet; draw-only, `probe-figshadow` gates it. People's figure/crowd draws are richly polished now; only the
  *static* standing crowds still cast no shadow. **⚠ The live ped/dog system is non-reproducible across page
  loads — probe figure DRAW changes by controlled placement, not a build-vs-build diff (137's findings).**) (**Sky's moon is FIXED (135) and now NAMED (144).** 135 re-clocked the moon's phase onto the slow `dayT`
  (~110 s/cycle) not the fast `year`, killing the ~2 Hz strobe; 144 shipped the moon-only HUD card 135 had banked — the
  census strip's 2nd stat reads `NN% / <phase>` from `moonWord()` off that same slow clock, a fifth reader of the one field
  (`probe-moonhud`: 1 transition/6 s at 8×, 8/8 phases, night agent confirmed card=disc). **STILL banked for Sky: the SEASON
  word** — it reads the fast `year` and would strobe ~0.7 Hz (134), so it needs a slow clock (or quantize/hold) FIRST; don't
  add `seasonWord(year)` to the HUD nor re-ship 134's REVERTED almanac assuming 135/144 unblocked it. Sky's additive/CA cells are still traps, see below.) (**132 took Water × Polish** — the kelp beds got a floating olive canopy so a bed reads as a living
  forest, not a flat dark hole, while staying the darkest thing inshore; `probe-kelp` gates it.)
  **Water's STILL-banked cue (123): the pier/lifeguard are still `rng()`-salted; site them on a depth by respending
  their draws (123's stream-neutral trick) — but that REPEATS 123's site-on-depth mechanism, so vary it.**
  **The asserts-less-than-the-code-knows tell is SPENT for agriculture** (orchard 129 + vineyard 139/148 + FARM
  183 — each tile's tooltip now names the season its draw already knew, off ONE shared `*Phase()` the draw and
  the string both read). **GARDEN is the last mute one and its draw does not read `year` at all.** **⚠ UPDATED BY
  206: that cue was right about the CODE and wrong about the PRIORITY — the tile it wanted to deepen barely EXISTED
  (6 hexes in the whole matrix; zero in one seed in three). 206 fixed the host (`GARDEN 6 → 17`, ~4/city, none
  buried), so the seasonal Deepen is now UNBLOCKED and is a good Nature × Deepen lap:** the three raised beds could
  run *staggered* calendars (beds at different stages is an allotment's whole visual identity — and it is a shape
  no other ag tile uses: FARM staggers whole FIELDS against each other, this would stagger BEDS within one plot),
  with the tooltip reading ONE shared `gardenPhase()` — run the tell FORWARDS (123), don't re-sync later. (Full
  recap rotated to `GROWTH-archive.md` at 204.) (**127 took People × New element** aimed not at its spent
  *entity* list but at its biggest untouched *surface* — PARK's 878 hexes now show day-only picnics. The lesson:
  "additive inventory spent" is a claim about a domain's entities, not its surfaces.) (**126 took Sky × Deepen** — the moon now keeps a calendar
  and the moonglade dims with its phase — which is the documented way past Sky's additive saturation: a Deepen
  that adds no element. Sky is no longer stale, and its empty `New CA rule` cell is still a trap, not an invitation.)
  **124 closed the ghost-`c.solar` cue — the LAST banked cue that moved a census number; from here the
  census is VACUOUS for most vectors, so reach for a probe.** Three steering laws, paid for by 118/119/123 and
  kept because they govern step 1: **a cue is a POINTER, NOT A SPEC** (123's banked cue misdescribed its own
  code — re-grep the seam before designing to it); **a banked, measured finding outranks both kind-rotation and
  cell-emptiness** (119); and **saturation beats kind-rotation** — 118 declined the header's own "coldest kind"
  steer and was right, because when a domain's additive cell is spent the KIND changes, not the domain. Full
  text rotated to `GROWTH-archive.md` at 204.
  **Sky's additive/CA cells are TRAPS, not invitations** (115 took Sky by adding nothing; sky is not cellular, and
  fog on terrain is already `rSea`/`fogAt`). Surveyed at 103; detail archived.
  **Cue (k) is FULLY CLOSED** (116 gave the sea a depth field, 123 stood the wind farm on it). **Still banked for
  Water:** the **pier** row and the **lifeguard tower** are still `rng()`-picked with rejection loops and should
  site on a *depth* — free via 123's trick, **respend an object's existing `rng()` draws rather than re-drawing
  them**, and the stream cannot move. **123 ran the tell FORWARDS** (make the string and the rule share ONE
  constant, so they cannot drift apart) — prefer that to re-syncing them later. **A derived field earns its keep
  when a RULE reads it, not when the draw shows it:** `rGreen`/`rShop`/`rServ` are still read by NOTHING but the
  walkable stat. **⚠ A tick-rule cannot read them directly (151): `recount()` never runs in the sim loop, so the
  reach maps are STALE inside `tick()`** — recompute locally, or pay a recount. (Detail archived at 200.)
  **Iteration 207 is the next holistic step-back** (105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 136, 142, 147, 152, 157, 162, 167, 172, 177, 182, 187, 192, 197, **202 — all done**). **202 was the 20th: a CLEAN BILL on the city, and the failure was in the INSTRUMENT** (see its recap above). 197 (the 19th) is where the PERF arc was first priced — 193+194+196 cost day +3.8/+4.4%, all of it 194's tree shadows, **priced and ACCEPTED** (198 measured every lever and closed them). **207 owes: price the ARC, not just the lap (`REF=<older step-back sha> perfab.mjs`), and shoot with `probes/shot-stepback.mjs`, NOT `shoot.mjs`+`?t=`/`?year=`.**
  **The GAP-CLOSING trick (111/112/113) is SPENT in four domains; the TELL that replaced it (a label asserting
  what the draw ignores) is CASHED 7x — 117 redwoods, 122 `CIVICLABEL`, 129 orchard, 140 plaza/quad, 148
  vineyard, 183 FARM, and 199 found its next host is a CONSTANT (see SKILL.md). Still MUTE: `[T.IND]` (no
  calendar) and GARDEN (season-frozen draw — needs a Deepen first). ⚠ 122's warning stands: a tooltip vector
  needs a probe checking the claim against INDEPENDENTLY RECOMPUTED truth, not a screenshot that it renders.
  **Sky-feedable list is EMPTY since 139** — every vegetation tile that can read `year` now does, so a further
  Sky interconnect needs a genuinely NEW derived field. (Full 111->148 history in `GROWTH-archive.md`.)
  **Kind-picking, compressed (full text + the 143-163 per-lap recaps rotated to `GROWTH-archive.md` at 204).**
  **Scale** is the coldest kind and a structural lever, not a lap move. **New element** (last 127): a saturated
  domain cannot take one — but saturation is of a domain's ENTITIES, so one can still land on a large untouched
  **surface** (127 put picnics on PARK's 878 hexes; 145 a daily rhythm on the beach). **Connect** (109, 111, 112,
  and now **204**): its trick is that it adds NO NEW OBJECT — it closes a gap between two that already exist.
  **107 was a New CA rule that ADDED NOTHING** — it rewrote a pass that had never fired; *auditing an existing
  rule for reachability* is a New-CA-rule move available in every domain at zero content cost (`probe-market.mjs`,
  and 204's `probe-firehost` is the same move on the fire pass — it found a ghost).
  Note **Nature × Connect was attempted and reverted three times** (46, 88,
  101) and is the row's graveyard: 46 found it geometrically impossible, 88 found it has no host
  draw-only, 101 found the host *and the land* and lost on **shape**. Do not re-open it as a
  *corridor*. **Cue (e½) is now CLOSED — iter 102 shipped the blob 101 prescribed** (the commons),
  so the interior has its lung; **do not plant a second one.** Nature's remaining cold cells are
  Connect (graveyard — leave it) and Scale.
- **⚠ THE PROBES ARE BLIND TO THE HUD, AND THE SKY IS SCARCE (iter 200 — read before siting ANYTHING in screen
  space).** Every probe in `probes/` reads `cvs.getImageData()`. **The HUD is not in the canvas.** `.placard` is a
  DOM card owning the whole **top-left corner** (`left:20px`, `max-width:300px`, tall); `.census`/`.controls` own
  the bottom corners. So a screen-space draw can be *invisible to the user* while a canvas probe calls it present
  and lovely: 200's first probe scored the golden-hour sun at **11,716 px** on a frame where it sat **entirely
  behind the placard**, and two agents on two seeds said "no sun" and were **RIGHT**. ⇒ for a VISIBILITY claim
  about a screen-space draw, diff **`page.screenshot()`** (DOM composited) — which occlusion-checks for free.
  Anything in a `ctx.setTransform(dpr,0,0,dpr,0,0)` block is screen space: **sun, moon, stars, shooting star.**
  And the sky is **measured, shallow and mostly spoken for**: the plate is a hexagon, so the open sky is a *band*
  — skyline **~0.12 of the viewport across the middle**, falling to 0.27–0.43 only in the top corners, and the
  top-left corner is the placard's. That is why the moon sits at **x=0.80**, and why 200's sun rises out of the
  **open sea** (right, deep corner sky) and sets **behind downtown** (left — it cannot go low, the placard is
  there). Little room is left for a second sky object; measure the band first. (General law, incl. the correction
  to "a probe is the verdict" — *only if it measures what the claim is about* — in SKILL.md.)
- **⚠ `peds` CANNOT SERVE THE ROAD NETWORK (iter 111, measured, before writing any code).** A resident
  is leashed to the open cell it is anchored to (`PEDLEASH=2`, and `stepPed`'s comment says that
  constant was tuned to hold street occupancy at ~19%). Only **20–31%** of bus stops have a live ped's
  anchor within a leash — even at radius 5 it is 56–75%. So "residents walk to / wait at / ride the X"
  vectors are structurally capped at ~a quarter of any road-borne host, and would leave the rest
  *emptier* than whatever decoration they replaced. To do it properly you must move the **spawn pool**
  (`openCells` in `syncFleet`), not the leash. Don't rediscover this.
- **PERF — the interleave is the ONLY honest grade, and it is NOT re-pinned.** The stored `perf-baseline.json`
  (day 33.16ms · night 37.33ms, pinned iter 105) has now false-FAILed **nine** step-backs running
  (125→130→136→142→147→152→157→162→**197**) because it always understates *today's* machine load — baking today's
  load in would blind the gate, so it stays stale on purpose. Grade a lap **only** by an interleaved A/B/A/B
  against the PREVIOUS step-back's commit, min per variant (`probes/perfab.mjs`, `REF=<sha>` since iter 197).
  Per-iteration history 105→162 (all ~ZERO except 142's +2.2% night) is in `GROWTH-archive.md`.
  **The day column is the NOISY one on this box — grade it only by min-of-≥2-rounds interleave and check the
  round spread; night is steady and is the SLOW-accumulating column** (night-only draws pile up there: 118's
  lit panes, 138's arterial lamps, 193's ferry lights).
  **The COST MODEL is now MEASURED, not guessed (198, `probes/probe-shadcost.mjs`): a canvas ornament costs
  PER-ELLIPSE (per path object rasterized) — NOT per `fill()`, NOT per unit area, and a pre-baked `drawImage`
  sprite is WORSE, not better.** So the levers on any future draw-cost regression are, in order: draw fewer
  objects (a *visual* decision, price it against what the ornament is worth), or accept it. **Batching fills,
  shrinking radii, and sprite-blitting are all CLOSED — measured, three ways, and none of them buys anything.**
  194's tree shadows are the standing example: ~3% for the grounding of every tree, and it is worth paying.
  197's non-flat lap (193+194+196 = day +3.8/+4.4%, night +2.9/+3.0% vs iter-192 `d8819ec`, **all of it 194's
  shadows**) is **priced and ACCEPTED**. 197's mandated *fix* ("the cost is the FILL COUNT — batch them into one
  fill") was **measured and DISPROVEN by 198**, and was rotated to `GROWTH-archive.md` at iter 199 rather than
  left here contradicting the paragraph above it.
  **⚠ THE COST MODEL HAS A HOLE, AND 200's SUN SITS IN IT.** 198's table (per-ellipse; area-independent; sprite
  worse) was measured on **SOLID fills only**. 200's sun is **two radial-GRADIENT fills** costing **day +2.3%/
  +1.7%** — a lot for *two* path objects under a strict per-path model. A gradient is evaluated **per pixel**, so
  it may be priced by **AREA** where a solid ellipse is not. **Nobody has measured that** — don't shrink `HR`
  "because 198 said area is free" (it said no such thing about gradients); the variant to build is a
  gradient-area sweep. 200's ~2% is **PAID** (it is the source of the whole golden-hour family).
  **⚠ A CHANGE THAT IS PROVABLY INERT IN ONE REGIME GIVES YOU A FREE NOISE FLOOR (199).** 199's edit draws
  nothing in daylight (0 panes at noon, *verified*), so its **day column IS the noise floor**: it read
  −0.0 / +0.1 / +1.0% on provably identical code. That is what "±1% means nothing" looks like when you can
  prove it, rather than assert it. Most late-game vectors are night-only or day-only — use the **dead regime as
  the control** instead of arguing with the noise.
  (**A 2+-round day+night interleave overruns the 120s Bash timeout — but do NOT pipe it through `tee`:
  node block-buffers stdout to a pipe, so a backgrounded run looks EMPTY until it exits and you will think it
  died (197 lost a run that way and re-ran it). Run it foreground with a long timeout, or read the task file
  after exit.** **⚠ `cp` is aliased `-i` here — use `/bin/cp` or every swap silently no-ops and you measure ONE
  file 4×, iter 147.**)
  **⚠ NEVER grade frame time by CONSECUTIVE passes (117 corrected 99).** Machine load is autocorrelated over
  minutes, so three passes in one loaded window are three samples of ONE draw: 117's gate read a perfectly
  STABLE +25.5/+26.0/+26.5% on a diff with **zero draw calls**, and the identical bytes read +3.5% twenty
  minutes later. Only an **interleaved A/B/A/B against pristine HEAD** (min per variant) reads true — and
  brace the shell interpolation (`/tmp/$v117.html` silently measures one variant six times). Full reasoning
  rotated to `GROWTH-archive.md` at iter 199; `perfab.mjs` implements it, and 199's inert-regime law (PERF
  bullet) tells you how big the noise floor actually is on the day you run it.
- **`?year=` IS NOW A URL HOOK (iter 108) — the seasons are finally testable.** `window.__setYear`
  had existed since the season pass but was **never wired to the query string**, so no screenshot in
  this loop's history could pin a *calendar* position: `?warp=61` from `year=1974` always lands on
  ~2035.0, i.e. **every shot ever taken of this city was in January.** Now
  `?seed=42&warp=61&year=2035.62` pins high summer. Applied *after* `warp` (warp advances `year`).
  Use `.02 / .30 / .62 / .87` for winter / spring / the golden dry peak / autumn — those are
  `applySeason`'s own keyframes. An unreachable test hook is the same defect class as iter 107's
  unreachable rule: **grep the URL block before assuming a hook you can see is a hook you can use.**
- **`?tide=` IS NOW A URL HOOK (iter 113) — the sea is testable, and every prior shot was a lie about it.**
  Same story as `?year=` one dimension over: `TIDE` runs a ~2 min seeded cycle and **no screenshot in this
  loop's history could pin it.** The default is seeded, not neutral — **`?seed=42` loads at TIDE 0.02, dead
  low water.** `?tide=v` shifts the cycle's *phase* (`__setTide`), so the sea keeps moving from where you put
  it rather than freezing. Use `.02 / .35 / .59 / .98` = low / mid-ebb / **neutral** / high. **`0.59` is the
  pin you want when grading anything ELSE on a marsh**: it sits below the flood-sheen cut (0.60) and at
  `ebb=0`, so the hex body is one flat color and nothing tidal can move.
- **`c.buzz` — the third derived field, after `c.flow` and `c.val` (iter 104, in `tick()`).** How much
  is there to come out FOR, seen from a hex: `ATTRACT.has(c.t)?2:0` plus a count of `ATTRACT`
  neighbours (`COM`/`MARKET`/`CIVIC`/`STADIUM`/`PLAZA`). Pure terrain derivation, no `rng()`,
  recomputed each tick. It is sparse — **mean 0.54–0.59 over standable hexes, and mostly 0** — so a
  rule keyed to it changes behaviour *only* near attractions and is a no-op across the rest of the
  city. Reuse it for anything meaning "somewhere worth standing"; don't hand-roll a second one.
  **⚠ `c.buzz` is NOT `PEDDEST`** — an attraction field must EXCLUDE the ground you stand on
  (`PEDDEST` is mostly open park, so its argmax is a lawn interior, not a shopfront kerb); see
  iter 104's archived note before re-deriving.
- **The CBD is published: `CBDX`/`CBDY` + `CORER`=16 (iter 98, L215).** `genWorld` has always laid a
  founding crossroads (`mainX`,`fy`) and grown the old town around it; it stayed local for 97
  iterations, so **no rule knew where downtown was**. Note `c.val` is *not* a centrality field — it
  diffuses `valueSrc`, whose peaks sit on **parks and water** (0.92/0.74), not on the core. Anything
  that means "near downtown" should use `hexDist(x,y,CBDX,CBDY)`, not `c.val` and not `CTRX/CTRY`
  (the plate's centre, which is not the city's).
- **⚠ The plate is a HEXAGON, not a square (U4):** `G` (=67) is only the bounding
  box the `cells` array lives in; the live plate is the `HEXR`=33 rings masked by
  `HEXOK`, and everything outside it is `T.VOID`. So: never loop `0..G` and assume
  a live cell — `inB()` gates it, `cellAt()` returns `null` off-plate, and a seeded
  random cell must come from **`HEXI`** (the live-cell list) or it lands in a dead
  corner. Each row's live span is `ROWMIN[y]`/`ROWMAX[y]`; the coast and its craft
  clamp to those. Per-tick development attempts are scaled by `KS`=1.46 because the
  plate carries ~46% more land than the old 48×48 square — a new per-tick placement
  loop should scale with `ks(n)` too, or it will fill proportionally slower.
- **⚠ Monorail and cable cars are PLURAL (U4):** `monos` / `gonds` are *lists* of
  independently grown lines, each closing its own loop. The old singular `monorail`,
  `monoPath`, `monoClosed`, `gond`, `gondPath` are gone — code written against them
  will silently read `undefined`.
- **Traffic flow exists — `c.flow` + `ARTFLOW` (iter 77).** `trafficFlow()` runs each
  tick: trips are generated by developed hexes and drain along the road network to the
  value core, accumulating like a river's drainage tree. `c.flow` is that accumulated
  load; `flow>=ARTFLOW` (64) is an **arterial** (~15% of roads, ~97/city). Unlike `busy`
  (a *local* ≥3-developed-neighbours test that calls a third of the city an avenue),
  flow is a **network** measure — ~200 high-flow roads are not `busy` and vice versa.
  **Bridges come out as the trunks unprompted** (seed 42's global max, 635, is a bridge
  deck), and the spine is connected: 153 of 155 arterial hexes touch another. `__find`
  now answers `'arterial'`. Reuse `c.flow` for anything that should follow the main
  roads — don't hand-roll a second notion of "important street". **Iter 80 is the
  first reuse:** civic forecourts pick the lot fronting the loudest street.
  **⚠ But flow is a bad host for *land use* (iter 82).** `RES→COM` on arterial
  frontage produced 85% **singletons** — by the time a street carries flow its
  frontage is already `COM`/`MID`/`TOWER`, so the houses left to convert are
  scattered. Flow suits *point* decisions (which lot fronts the loudest street) far
  better than *linear* ones (grow a high street). Don't re-try RES→COM on arterials.
- **Institutions cluster: `MAJORK` / `QUARTER` / `siteQuarter()` (iter 91).** `MAJORK` = the five monumental
  kinds (`hall museum parliament university library`), the shared vocabulary for "major institution" used by
  BOTH the civic quarter and the 2020+ forecourt rule. `QUARTER` = the three that *seek* it (library, museum,
  parliament); services stay sited by need, and `observatory` is deliberately free to sit at the rim.
  `siteQuarter()` hugs the nearest standing major at `QNEAR..QFAR` = **2-4 hexes** (adjacency would kill the
  bunting, which needs a ROAD cell reachable from two civics); it falls back to the scattered search when the
  core is walled in, so `civicKinds` never drops. Detail archived at 200.
- **A forecourt is now SHARED, by construction (iter 91).** The 2020+ rule skips a civic with a `PLAZA` within 2
  hexes and quarter members sit 2-4 apart, so the quarter gets **one** square, not four (`PLAZA 14->10`).
  Defensible urbanism, accepted — but it is the one place that vector *cost* something. See open cue (d).
- **Open cues, banked by holistic passes (take one when its domain comes up):**
  (Cues **(l)**, **(e½)** and **(d)** are all CLOSED and were rotated to `GROWTH-archive.md` at iter 201.)
  **(g) THIRTEEN lines / SIXTEEN seedless `hashCell` calls remain** — **iter 103's audit grep undercounted,
  and iter 113 corrected it.** The old pattern
  (`grep -nE 'hashCell\([^)]*,[[:space:]]*(0x)?[0-9]+\)' … | grep -v seedNum`) matches only a **bare integer**
  salt, so every `k+90` / `j+40` / `r*3+cc+50` form was invisible — incl. **two of the marsh's own three**. Superset:
  `grep -noE 'hashCell\([^;]{0,60}' solvista.html | grep -v seedNum` (then discard the L182 definition and
  genWorld's L510/511/523, which pass the real `seed`). Each survivor is a function of `(x,y[,j])` alone, so
  it paints the identical pattern in every city. Two stakes, and **only the first is an invariant breach
  worth a vector**:
  - **Presence decisions** (something is there, or isn't, in the same place in every city):
    **L2747** `hashCell(x,y,77)<0.28` — which surf cells catch the city's light-smear at night.
  - **Ornament jitter** (a detail's lean/length/brightness, not its existence): kelp sway **L2799**,
    palm fronds **L2832 ×2 / L2834 ×2**, orchard fruit **L3248/3249**, **park fireflies L3423 ×2**
    (identical firefly positions in every city), **L3610/3613**, **L5113/5117**.
    The marsh reed tufts were **CLOSED by iter 113** (and its lean salt `hashCell(x,j,7)` took no `y`, so
    every marsh hex in a column leaned identically). The tower window-lights
    (`hashCell(x,z|0,3|5|9|13)` — every city's towers lit identically at night, the *most visible*
    of the class) were **CLOSED by iter 110**, folded into its TOWER Polish; they now mix `seedNum`.
  Note `darkWinR` is **not** a breach: it takes a literal `salt` argument but mixes `seedNum^salt`
  internally — check the callee before indicting a call site. And when you fix a range, **space the bases**:
  `0x9EE1+j` / `0x9EE2+j` / `0x9EE3` collide at `j=2` (iter 113).
  **(i) the marsh reeds do not read, and that is a `polish-tile` job** *(banked by 113, Water)* — the reed calendar
  shipped in 113 is wired and measurable, but the reeds are **seven sub-pixel strokes huddled around the pool**, so
  the hex reads as "green hex with a pool" and the calendar is invisible at fit zoom. Spreading/lengthening them is
  a tile redesign, out of scope for a growth lap, and would pay off at once — the seasonal colour is already computed.
  **(m) SHOWERS ARE HOST-STARVED — do not build "X responds to the rain" (iter 201, measured before designing).**
  Rain is fully realised (shaft, drops, damp patch that dries behind the shower, rainbow) and **nothing on the
  ground reads `cl.rain`** — a tempting seam. But `probes/probe-rainhost.mjs` swept every rain cloud across its
  whole traverse: a shower's ground footprint (the damp ellipse, `R=48*cl.s`, y-squashed 0.30) covers **2–5 hexes
  TOTAL**, of which **BEACH 0.1–0.2 and PARK 0.17–0.31** per shower-frame, at 1–2 rain clouds per seed. At any
  moment a shower rains on **less than one** picnic/café hex. This is `T.MARKET` again (the dead-code law): the
  vector has no host. Widening the footprint is a Sky change to a tuned draw, and gradients price by AREA (see
  the PERF hole).
  **(o) THE PORT HAS NO WATERFRONT — do not build "the ship docks / cargo comes ashore / cranes work her /
  lighters run to a wharf / the harbor works are fed by sea" (iter 205, `probes/probe-harborhost.mjs`, 6 seeds,
  unanimous).** `SHOREX`=`CTRX+11` is *the coast highway column*; `SHORE0`=`SHOREX+5` is the water's edge *"five
  lots seaward of the highway"*; the warehouses are sited at `SHOREX-1..-3`, **behind** it. So they stand **5-9
  hexes from the sea**, the waterline at `harborY` is **BEACH/DUNE/SHOREPARK** on every seed, and **no quay or
  wharf tile exists**. Solvista is a **roadstead** — an open anchorage — so the anchored freighter is *correct*,
  not broken, however loudly her comment ("waiting on a berth") and her tooltip ("Serving the harbor works") read
  like the label-tell. A port vector must **build the waterfront FIRST** (a quay/wharf tile on an industrial
  shore): a terrain lap with real cost, not an entity-motion freebie. **Banked host, if one is ever wanted: the
  MOLE is real and reliable** — `moleSet` is 5-12 cells on all 6 seeds probed (the `path.length>=5` guard bites
  less often than its comment implies), and it is the artifact's only built structure standing in the water.
- **Reach maps exist — reuse them (U5):** `reachFill(out, r, isSrc)` is a
  multi-source hex BFS capped at radius `r`, walking over land only (`WETSET` blocks
  water/marsh/kelp), filling `out` with steps-to-nearest-source and 255 for "farther
  than r". `recount()` already runs four per tick (transit / green / shop / service).
  Any "how far is X from Y" question should call it rather than hand-rolling a flood
  fill. Cost is ~1ms per `recount()`, which is per *tick*, not per frame.
- **⚠ Three census stats can FALL, by design (U5):** `walkPct`, `transitPct` and
  `solarPct` are shares of residents/roofs, not counts. Green space and shops
  saturate >90% on their own, so **services are walkable's binding constraint** — a
  tower lap that adds residents without civics will *drop* `walkPct`, and that is
  the stat working, not a regression. Judge them by whether the city earned the
  change, not by "up = good". `density` (residents per developed hex) rises with
  intensification and falls with sprawl.

## Iteration 197 — the nineteenth step-back finds a clean city and a real perf cost (2026-07-12) [holistic step-back]

**Vector** — the mandated ~5-iteration step-back (105/110/115/120/125/130/136/142/147/152/157/162/167/172/177/182/187/192/**197**). The nineteenth. Isolates iters **193** (ferry night lights), **194** (tree contact shadows) and **196** (kelp tide response) — 195 was reverted byte-identical — by interleaving HEAD against iter-192's file (`d8819ec`). Not a domain × kind lap: it reads the WHOLE city for cumulative drift the census and the per-feature gates are blind to. It also owed two flagged watch items an answer.

**Housekeeping — a DESTRUCTIVE rollback was found sitting in the worktree, and discarded.** Startup found `solvista.html` dirty with a diff that *deleted* 193's ferry lights, 194's tree/palm shadows and 196's kelp tide and added nothing (4 insertions were just the old kelp lines returning). It was not a half-finished iteration but a **stale pristine-control backup copied back over the artifact** — almost certainly a killed perf/probe run that had `/bin/cp`'d HEAD aside and died before restoring. `git stash`ed rather than deleted (stash: *"iter197: stale pristine-backup rollback…"*). **Law for the next runner: a dirty tree whose diff only ever SUBTRACTS shipped features is a corrupted control file, not work to keep — the skill's "keep it if census passes" rule assumes the diff ADDS something, and census would have passed this one happily.**

**Census** — PASS. Every core aggregate flat (pop/developed/roads unmoved; `solarRoofs` −2, `towerHt` +1 = chaotic-CA noise). Tile histogram empty. Correct and expected: all three isolated iterations are draw-only, so the census proves only that no page threw.

**Perf — the finding. FIRST non-flat lap since 142, and it is REAL.** Interleaved A/B/A/B vs iter-192 (`d8819ec`), min per variant, run **twice independently**:

| run | day | night |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 36.61 → 38.22ms (**+4.4%**) | 47.55 → 48.94ms (**+2.9%**) |
| B | 40.72 → 42.28ms (**+3.8%**) | 42.83 → 44.11ms (**+3.0%**) |

Two runs agree, and the number matches **194's own self-reported cost** (day +3.4% / night +3.5%) almost exactly — so **the entire lap's cost is 194's tree shadows; 193's ferry lights and 196's kelp tide are free** (both are tiny host counts: 18 ferries, 8–17 kelp beds). Within precedent and NOT an emergency (118 shipped +5.1% night; 142's +2.2% was accepted and never fixed), but this loop *only ever adds*, and this is a per-object `fill()` on the most numerous object on the plate. **The lever is already proven: 194 tried memoizing `shadS`'s `rgba()` string and measured ZERO, which means the cost is the FILL COUNT, not the string.** `shadS` (L2843) is `fillStyle=…; beginPath(); ellipse(); fill()` — one full rasterization per tree, ~4 per forest hex. **⇒ 198 is mandated as the fix: batch a hex's tree shadows into ONE path with ONE `fill()`.**

**Watch item (a) — 194's tree shadows: perf cost CONFIRMED, visual fear was CONFABULATION (3rd time).** 194's own agent had warned the dense grove went "olive-muddy, near the tolerable limit" (the kelp failure mode) and 194's probe disproved it (FOREST mean luminance −0.36..−0.44 of 255). 197's two fresh, blind whole-city agents independently read the groves as **"grounded-and-clean… canopies stay green rather than olive-muddy"** (seed 42) and **"grounded, not muddy — the contact shadows sit tight under each trunk"** (seed 7). The shadows are visually right; only their cost is wrong.

**Watch item (b) — 196's kelp-banding cue: CLOSED, and it CANNOT FIRE.** 196 banked "at HIGH water the kelp hexes are still the darkest pixels in the water — if the bed count ever grows, kelp is the first thing that would band." The census tile histogram settles it: **KELP is 17/10/8 beds on the three seeds and IDENTICAL across all three eras (1985/2005/2035)** — the beds are placed at `genWorld` and *nothing in `tick()` grows them*, so the precondition has no mechanism. Both agents also confirmed the coast directly: "no dark lining, no crusty seam where the kelp bed sits" / "clean sand→turquoise gradient with no dark lining or halo band." The historic dark-coast failure mode stays closed.

**Seasons alive** — `probe-season`: FARM winter→dry-peak **88.4** (identical to 192's), VINEYARD 44.6→36.7, ORCHARD 25.3→41.4, FOREST 20.6→19.7, ROAD control 0.5–2.1. The calendar is working across every agriculture tile.

**Visual** — whole-frame reads at 3 lights × 2 calendars (day golden `year=2035.62` / night / winter `year=2035.02`), 2 seeds (42, 7), one agent each, asked the *cumulative-drift* question and given a **locate** task. **Both VISUAL: PASS.** Night core located by light alone at **(0.47,0.45)+(0.47,0.62)** and **(0.53,0.57)** — matching the historical band (177: (.48,.50)/(.53,.60); 172: (.47,.55)/(.45,.62)), so 115/143's CBD lighting holds. No z-order tears, no floaters, no mojibake, no blowout. Winter reads as a real but mild variant on both seeds (seed 7's agent called it "the weakest signal in the set") — that is 120's known by-design evergreen/irrigated dilution, a composition fact, not a dead calendar.

**Verdict — FIXED** (no city change; `solvista.html` byte-identical to HEAD). The step-back's *job* was done: it found something. **The thirteen-clean-bill streak ends at 197 — not on the city, which is balanced, readable and beautiful at ~197 iterations, but on the frame budget.** The one durable improvement shipped here is to the harness: **`probes/perfab.mjs` now takes `REF=<sha>`** so a step-back can grade a whole lap against the previous step-back's commit instead of only HEAD-vs-working-file — the exact measurement this step exists to make, which it previously could not express. **198 = the tree-shadow perf fix (Nature × Polish); the lap then resumes owing Urban (189).** Next step-back at **202**.

## Iteration 198 — the tree shadows cost what they cost (2026-07-12) [Nature × Polish, EXPLORED -> REVERTED]

**Vector** — 197's *mandated* perf fix: "batch a hex's tree shadows into ONE path with ONE `fill()`." Not a rotation pick; the step-back rule says a measured regression outranks adding more. It ends REVERTED, and the value of the iteration is the measurement that killed it.

**Change (built, measured, reverted)** — `treeGroup(f)` + a `TMODE`/`TSHAD` queue: `tree()` queues its contact ellipse instead of filling it, the group lays a whole stand down in one path + one `fill()`, then draws the bodies over it. Wired into the only four multi-tree hexes (FOREST 2-4, PARK 2-3, the boulevard allee, and the 2-tree case at ~L3769) — a single-tree hex is already one fill and can gain nothing. It worked, and it was pointless: **day +0.3%, night +0.1%** (interleaved A/B vs pristine HEAD, `probes/perfab.mjs`). `solvista.html` is now **byte-identical to HEAD**.

**The finding — 197's lever was an INFERENCE, and it was WRONG.** 197 reasoned: 194 memoized `shadS`'s `rgba()` string and bought back zero, therefore the cost is the FILL COUNT, therefore batch the fills. Nobody measured it. So 198 stopped tuning and wrote `probes/probe-shadcost.mjs`, which **discriminates between mechanisms** instead of testing one plausible fix — five variants, every one built from HEAD by string surgery (so it reproduces from a clean tree and can never silently measure HEAD against itself), interleaved per round, min per variant, **three independent runs**:

| variant | what it holds fixed | day | night |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NOSHAD` remove tree+palm shadows | — (the whole budget) | **−3.1 / −2.8 / −1.3%** | **−2.6 / −2.4 / −3.5%** |
| `BATCH` 197's mandate, ¼ the fills | same ellipses, same area | +0.3 / +0.9 / +2.7% | +0.1 / +1.5 / −0.3% |
| `SMALLR` radius ×0.5 (¼ the AREA) | same count of fills | +0.4 / +0.9 / −0.6% | +0.4 / +1.1 / 0.0% |
| `SPRITE` pre-baked ellipse, `drawImage` | same shadows, no path raster | **+4.1 / +2.3%** | **+3.6 / +2.0%** |

**Only `NOSHAD` ever moves.** Quartering the fill *count* buys nothing; quartering the fill *area* buys nothing; replacing the path with a sprite blit is **worse**. ⇒ **The cost is PER-ELLIPSE** — one charge per ellipse rasterized, near-independent of its size, of how many are grouped into a single `fill()`, and not avoidable by blitting. `ctx.fill()` is not the unit of cost; the **path object** is, and batching N ellipses into one fill still rasterizes N ellipses.

**Why it is REVERTED rather than shipped** — the batch is +0.3% (i.e. nothing), costs a `TMODE` state machine and a double pass over each stand, and slightly changes pixels (a union fill stops two overlapping shadows double-darkening). Machinery that buys nothing does not earn its place. The one lever left on the ~3% is **drawing fewer ellipses** — un-grounding some trees — and that is a *visual* decision, not an optimization: 194's grounding is the thing 197's agents twice read as "grounded, not muddy — the contact shadows sit tight under each trunk," after twice suspecting it. **The ~3% is the honest price of the shadows, and it is worth paying** (precedent: 118 shipped +5.1% night; 142's +2.2% was accepted and never fixed). Perf is not free, but neither is beauty, and this loop has been told which one it is buying.

**Census** — PASS, on the BATCH build *and* again on the restored HEAD. Every core aggregate flat, tile histogram empty. Correct and vacuous, as any draw-only iteration's census is.

**Visual** — none taken, and none owed: the file is byte-identical to HEAD, so there is nothing to look at (195's precedent).

**Verdict — EXPLORED → REVERTED.** The city is unchanged; the loop's *knowledge* is not. Three perf levers are now closed by measurement instead of standing open as folklore, and `probes/probe-shadcost.mjs` is committed so the next runner who eyes a draw-cost regression can rerun the table in one command rather than re-deriving it. **Law promoted to `SKILL.md`: a perf lever is a HYPOTHESIS — measure it before you mandate it, and characterize a cost with variants that DISCRIMINATE between mechanisms, not one plausible fix.** A step-back should name the **suspect**, not the **fix**; 197 named the fix and spent an iteration proving it wrong. **The domain lap resumes at 199 owing Urban (189, Deepen/Polish only); next step-back at 202.**

## Iteration 199 — the city goes to bed (2026-07-12) [Urban fabric × Deepen]

**Vector.** Urban fabric × Deepen. Rotation owed Urban (last lap 189) and the header
pins it **Deepen/Polish only** — additive spent (118), Connect measured-hard twice
(160/165), roof-furniture closed city-wide. Kind repeats 189's Deepen on 184's
precedent: when a domain is saturated to two kinds, **saturation beats kind-rotation.**

**The seam.** `winBandR` paints a lit pane wherever `hashCell(...) >= WINDARK` and leaves
the rest as wall — and its own comment calls that remainder **"nobody home"**. That is an
assertion about *occupancy*, which is the one thing about a city that changes across a
night. But `WINDARK` was a **constant (0.16)**. So the same panes were dark at 8pm and at
4am, and every window lit at dusk still burned until dawn: **the city never went to bed.**
This is 194's tell one turn further in — not a tooltip asserting what the draw ignores, but
a **CONSTANT whose NAME asserts what its VALUE cannot do**. And `LITAMT` cannot carry the
hour either: the light curve **PINS it at 1.0 from dayT 0.86 all the way to midnight**, so
the whole evening is one flat plateau. The hour had to come from `dayT` — the slow clock the
moon (135), the hall clock (149) and the observatory dome (158) already share. Fifth reader.

**Change.** `WINDARK` becomes a floor, and `windarkAt(t)` sweeps the threshold up through
the panes as `nightDeep()` (a smoothstep over dayT 0.70..1.06, the span where paned glass is
actually drawn) runs from dusk to the small hours. **Per building type** — homes empty
fastest, offices keep a late shift, towers keep a skeleton crew: RES .10→.52, MID .14→.40,
COM .15→.36, TOWER .17→.28. **The differential is the point, not the dimming**: the
residential fringe goes dark while downtown stays lit, so the night core (143) *sharpens* as
the night deepens instead of the city merely getting darker.
Two things deliberately **not** done, and both are load-bearing:
- **`colWin`'s mean-holder stays pinned to the BASELINE `WINDARK`.** It exists to make the
  paned band read at the tone the solid ribbon it replaced did, at a *fixed* hour. If `a`
  chased the hour too, colWin would **brighten every surviving pane to hold the block's
  mean** — cancelling the very signal (a sleeping city IS darker) and clipping the survivors
  to white at the top of the sweep. So a lit pane keeps exactly the colour it always had, and
  the darkening is carried honestly, by panes going out. This is what makes "0 lighter px"
  provable rather than lucky.
- **No new randomness.** The existing per-pane `hashCell` is reused as-is, so each pane
  already carries a fixed "how late this household stays up" and the rising threshold sweeps
  up through them **in a stable order** — windows wink out one by one instead of re-rolling.
  Stream-neutral by construction.
Tooltip: a live `Windows` row (`Nearly all lit` / `Lights going out` / `Most are asleep` /
`Dark — the block sleeps`) read off the **same `windarkAt()`** the panes are drawn from — one
predicate, one definition — and shown only while the panes exist (`LITAMT>=0.35`).

**Census.** PASS. Every metric **+0**, tile histogram **empty**, entity counts flat — correct
and expected: draw-only, no `rng()`, no terrain, no new tile/entity. Vacuous, so the probe is
the gate.

**Probe** (`probes/probe-bedtime.mjs`). A **state-response** question (196's law), so the
isolation is two pins of `dayT` **within one build** (frozen clock, same `genWorld`), run on
both builds. The count is harvested by **wrapping `winQuad`** (fires once per lit pane) and
`winBandR` (which knows the cell) — it counts *actual draw calls*, not my own formula, so it
is not circular. 3 seeds:
- **BASE: the pane count is EXACTLY frozen dusk→midnight — 0.0% on all four types, all three
  seeds.** That is the seam stated as a number: a constant threshold *cannot* know the hour.
- **PATCH: RES 36.8–37.5% go dark · MID 24.4–25.8% · COM 17.6–20.0% · TOWER 10.0–11.0%** —
  a **3.42–3.70× differential**, homes over towers.
- **MIDNIGHT patch-vs-base: 1.2–1.5% of frame changed, 100% DARKER, 0.000% lighter** (at
  THR=10, above the noise floor) — the anti-blowout gate: panes can only ever go *out*.
- **CONTROL noon: 0 panes drawn on BOTH builds** (the paned branch isn't taken in daylight, so
  the edit is *unreachable* there) and the frame is **byte-identical**, 0 px, on all 3 seeds.
- **POSITIVE CONTROL: the dayT pin is live** — BASE dusk→midnight moves ~55% of the frame. Without
  it, "BASE panes frozen" would be a dead pin rather than a finding (196).

**Perf.** FREE, and this iteration came with its **own zero control**: the day frame runs
*provably identical code* (0 panes drawn at noon), so whatever day reads IS the noise floor.
Three interleaved rounds vs pristine HEAD (`perfab.mjs`): **day −0.0% / +0.1% / +1.0%**
(identical code ⇒ floor ≈1%), **night +1.5% / −1.4% / −0.2%** — centred on zero, sign flipping.
Within its own control. (It draws *fewer* path objects at night, which by 198's per-ellipse cost
model should if anything be cheaper; it is not measurably either way.)

**Visual.** Both seeds **VISUAL: PASS**, and both agents **LOCATED blind** (108's law): given
two unlabelled night frames and asked *which is later*, with the A/B labels **deliberately
inverted between the seeds** so a coin-flip cannot pass both, seed 42's agent said "A" (truth:
A = midnight) and seed 7's said "B" (truth: B = midnight) — each reasoning from the window
pattern ("punched through with dark cells… lit windows have gone stochastic and patchy"). Both
confirmed the differential reads and that the core holds: *"the contrast between core and
periphery is actually stronger… which is the right nocturnal read."* No muddiness (the historic
kelp failure mode), no tears, no blowout: *"only the window emissives dropped… the correct,
localized behaviour."*

**Findings banked.**
- **The pelican `flock` is a probe-hygiene trap.** It is a lone `Math.random`-spawned *object*
  (`let flock=null`), not one of the entity *arrays* 163's law tells you to clear — so it
  survives the standard freeze and drifts per page load. It was the **entire per-load noise
  floor** (~100–600 scattered px, max delta ~8) that made this probe's first run false-FAIL its
  own daylight control. `flock = null` in the freeze and noon goes to an honest **0 px on every
  seed**. Add it to the freeze list; 195(f)'s "an honest zero is what makes every other number
  readable" applies exactly.
- **A provably-inert regime is a free perf noise floor** — promoted to SKILL.md.
- **A constant whose NAME asserts a behaviour its VALUE cannot have** is the tell's next host —
  promoted to SKILL.md. Still-mute draws remain banked: `c.hedge`, `c.party`, `c.shroom`.

**Verdict: SHIPPED.**

## Iteration 200 — the sun is in the sky (2026-07-12) [Sky & atmosphere × Polish]

**Vector.** Sky & atmosphere × Polish. Sky was the stalest domain (last at 190) and is
post-saturation — Deepen/Polish only — and Deepen had run four of the last five laps, so
Polish (last at 115) was the coldest kind in the stalest domain.

**Change.** **The city has had a whole FAMILY of low-sun effects for dozens of iterations —
warm cloud bellies (161), the sea's golden sheen (181), the noon sun-glitter (150), the raked
window glass (190), beach furniture that follows the sun (145), roof panels tilted at it — and
the sun itself was never drawn.** The draw code's own comments name it ("the low sun lights
cloud bellies", "the sun-facing face", "under the day sun"); the MOON has a disc, a phase,
earthshine, a halo and a glade on the water. Every warm thing in this sky had a cause that was
not on screen. That is 179/193/195's shape — a completed family missing one member — except
here the missing member is the *source*.

It invents no signal. Its SIDE is `dayT`'s (rises RIGHT, sets LEFT — the very rule 190's `gs`
uses to choose which face of the glass to rake) and its COLOUR is `GWARM`/`GWSB`, so it is the
**fifth reader** of the one golden-hour signal 161/181/190 already share: the disc is visibly
the source of exactly the warmth those three paint. Two draws — a halo that is a **radial
gradient falling to alpha 0 at the rim** (195's law: a flat additive `arc()` is a coin, not a
glow) and a disc whose rim softens into it. Drawn into the sky slab *before* the city, like the
moon, so the skyline occludes it. Gated on `dayT` ∈ [`SUNUP`,`SUNDN`] — **not new numbers: the
light curve's own dawn/dusk keyframes (0.05 / 0.78)** — so it touches the horizon exactly as the
sky turns warm, and **draws literally nothing at night**.

**Two things the measurement forced, neither of which was guessable:**
1. **`GWARM` alone cannot carry the disc down.** It is gated on the low sky being ORANGE
   (`R−B > 70`), and by the time the sun actually touches the horizon the sky has gone PURPLE —
   so GWARM has already fallen back to 0 and a GWARM-only sun turns **WHITE at the exact moment
   it should be an ember**. The probe caught it as a number: horizon warmth **20.6 vs noon 20.9,
   identical**. Altitude has to redden it the rest of the way, and toward a *fixed* ember — not
   toward `GWSB`, which by then is lilac.
2. **The arc is shaped by the plate and by the HUD.** The plate is a hexagon, so the open sky is
   a shallow **band** (skyline ~0.12 of the viewport across the middle, deep only in the
   corners), and **`.placard` owns the top-left corner**. So the sun rises low out of the **open
   sea** on the right, climbs to clear the rooftops, and **sets behind downtown** on the left —
   it cannot go low there, the placard is in the way. An agent noted the dusk sun sits *higher*
   than the dawn sun and "reads backwards"; that asymmetry is the constraint, and it happens to
   be right for this city (open water east, high skyline west).

**Census.** PASS, 0 page errors. `pop/roads/developed` **+0 / +0 / +0**, tile histogram empty —
correct and near-vacuous for a draw-only change (no terrain, no `rng()`).

**Probe.** `probes/probe-sun.mjs`. **⚠ It screenshots the PAGE, not the canvas, and that is the
whole finding of this iteration.** The first version read `cvs.getImageData()` like every other
probe here, and confidently scored the golden-hour sun at **11,716 changed px** on a frame where
the sun was **entirely behind the DOM placard** — while two visual agents, on two seeds, twice,
reported no sun and were **RIGHT**. A canvas readback cannot see the HUD. `page.screenshot()`
composites DOM over canvas exactly as the user sees it, so the diff measures only the sun that
*can actually be seen*, and gets occlusion-checking for free.
On the shipped build, 3 seeds × 7 dayT pins:
- **ARC centroid x 0.90 → 0.79 → 0.62 → 0.41 → 0.33 — MONOTONIC right→left on every seed**
  (rises E, sets W: agrees with 190's `gs`). Highest at noon (cy 0.088).
- **REDDENS: disc R−B 21 (noon, a white 247,247,226) → 110 (sunset, an ember 235,164,126).**
- **SEEN: 13k–26k visible px at every day pin; contrast 31–97 against the local sky** (presence
  is not legibility — iter 101).
- **NIGHT: `sunDraws` = 0** at both night pins on all 3 seeds, counted by hooking the renderer's
  own `createRadialGradient` — so the dead regime is *proved* dead, not asserted from my formula.
  Stray night px (0–16) sit inside the probe's own base-vs-base noise floor.

**Visual.** Both seeds **VISUAL: PASS** (third round; the first two FAILed on the buried sun and
were correct to). The agents **located the disc within ~0.01 of the shipped formula on every
frame** — day (0.71, 0.09) vs predicted (0.714, 0.097); golden (0.37, 0.10) vs (0.381, 0.108);
dawn (0.89, 0.16) vs (0.898, 0.163) — which is what made their "there is no sun here" credible
rather than vague. No coin rim, no orphan glow, no z-order tears; whole frames still read as a
balanced coastal city.

**Perf.** ⚠ **day +2.3% / +1.7%** (two interleaved A/B runs vs pristine HEAD, `probes/perfab.mjs`);
**night −0.2% / −0.4%**, which is the **free inert control** (199's law — the sun draws zero calls
at night, *verified*, so night runs byte-identical code and whatever it reads IS the noise floor).
The day cost is real and is **PAID**: cheaper than 194's tree shadows (+3.4%, also paid), for the
most fundamental object in a daylight sky. **Banked:** it is *two radial-GRADIENT fills*, and
198's per-ellipse cost model was measured on **solid** fills only — a gradient rasterizes per
pixel, so it may be priced by AREA where a solid ellipse is not. 198's table does not answer that.

**Verdict.** SHIPPED.

**Findings (promoted to SKILL.md).**
- **The probe reads the CANVAS; the user sees the CANVAS + the DOM.** For a visibility claim about
  a *screen-space* draw, diff `page.screenshot()`, not the canvas. Anything in a
  `ctx.setTransform(dpr,0,0,dpr,0,0)` block is screen space: sun, moon, stars, shooting star.
- **"A probe is the verdict, not a rerun" — but ONLY if the probe measures what the claim is
  about.** This is the first recorded case where the agents were right and the probe was wrong,
  and the standing law would have told me to override them. When a probe and an agent disagree,
  don't re-run either: **first ask what layer each one is looking at.**
- **The sky on this plate is scarce and measured**, not open space — a shallow band, with the
  top-left corner owned by the placard (which is why the moon sits at x=0.80).

## Iteration 201 — the beach follows the tide (2026-07-12) [People & activity × Deepen]

**Vector** — People & activity × Deepen. People was the stalest domain (last lap 191);
its basics are long spent, so Deepen, not another entity.

**The seam** — iter 145 taught the beach furniture to follow the **sun** (`LITAMT` gates the
parasols in through the morning and packs them away by dusk), and the beach *ground* has
answered the **tide** since long before that — the damp margin `w2=2.4+(1-TIDE)*5` sweeps up
and down the sand, and iter 196 used it as its positive control *precisely because* it
provably reads `TIDE`. But the furniture itself was drawn at `px(gx,gy)`, the bare hex
centre. So the sunbathers answered one signal and were deaf to the other, and **at dead low
water they were lying on wet sand.** 196's shape (a tile deaf to a signal its own hex
already reads), one tile along, in the People domain.

**Change** — draw-only. `wetReach()` now owns the damp band's reach as **one definition with
two readers** — the margin that *strokes* the wet sand, and the beachgoers who must stay
*off* it. Let those drift apart and the towels end up laid in the surf; sharing the constant
makes that unrepresentable. `seaDirS(x,y)` gives the mean unit vector toward a hex's WATER
neighbours (same water test the margin uses — a river is not the sea), `null` when
landlocked. The whole ensemble (parasol, pole, towel) slides along that normal by
`(WETMIN+0.5*WETSWING) - wetReach()`, i.e. **the band's own reach either side of its mid-tide
value** — so it retreats up the sand as the ebb widens the wet band, follows the water back
down on the flood, and sits exactly where it always did at mid-tide. No new randomness, no
terrain, no `rng()`.

**Census** — vacuous, as expected for draw-only: PASS, every metric +0, tile histogram empty.
Proves only that nothing threw and that the seeded stream is untouched.

**Probe** — `probes/probe-beachtide.mjs`. A **state-response** claim, so 196's isolation: one
build rendered twice at two `TIDE` pins (frozen clock, same `genWorld`), the only variable
being the tide. Measures **draw calls, not pixels** (199's wrap-the-draw move) — `ctx.ellipse`
is wrapped and the parasol canopy captured by its `4.5x2.6` signature, which occurs **exactly
once** in the file. No pixel noise floor at all, so the zero is an honest zero.

| build | along-seaward | perp (ctl) | landlocked (ctl) | tide-px (live?) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BASE  | **0.00px** (3/3 seeds) | 0.00 | 0.00 (n=26–30) | 10.0–11.4k |
| PATCH | **+4.80px** (3/3 seeds) | 0.00 | 0.00 (n=26–30) | 10.5–11.9k |

`BASE 0.00` **is the seam, as a number** — the draw was deaf. `PATCH +4.80px` is the travel
the design predicts to two decimal places (pins sweep 0.02→0.98, so 0.96 × the band's 5px
swing). Direction is checked against a seaward normal the probe **recomputes from the terrain
itself**, not by calling `seaDirS` (122's law). Controls: perpendicular drift 0.00 (it travels
along the shore normal, not sideways); the 26–30 **landlocked** beach hexes per seed move
0.00px (no sea to answer → furniture stays put). **Positive control**: the damp margin moves
~10–12k px on *both* builds, so the TIDE pin is LIVE — without it `BASE=0` would be a dead pin
rather than a deaf draw (196's law, and it is what makes the zero mean anything).

**Perf** — not run, and **provably not needed**: the diff adds **zero path objects** (verified
by grep — it re-centres ellipses/line/rect that were already drawn) plus ~240 neighbour lookups
per frame. Under 198's measured cost model (cost is *per path object rasterized*), that is free
by construction. Measuring it would only have re-measured the box's noise.

**Visual** — the first pass FAILed on **my framing, not the feature**: `shoot.config.json`'s
`coast` clip is a hard-coded rectangle and the coastline moves seed to seed, so on seed 7 it
landed on open water with the beach off the edge of the crop. Fixed with
`probes/shot-beachtide.mjs`, which **aims the camera** at a beach hex that actually draws a
parasol *and* faces the sea (found from the real draw calls). Re-shot, both seeds **VISUAL
PASS**, blind, with the A/B labels **inverted between the seeds**: both agents correctly
located dead low water from the wide damp flat, and both confirmed the invariant — *"neither
frame puts a pole or towel on wet sand"*; *"the only things standing on wet sand are gulls and
a dog — correct."*

**The one objection, and why it did not sink it** — the seed-42 agent's first read called the
response **inverted** (a real beach hands you *more* sand at low tide; mine retreats up it).
This is a property of the **artifact's tide model, not of this change**: the coastline is fixed
terrain and cannot recede, so the ebb can only express itself as the intertidal flat drying out
*inland* of the fixed edge. Flipping the sign would drive the towels **onto the widening wet
band** — contradicting the single invariant the feature is built on. Two fresh, correctly-framed,
independent reads both declined the objection: *"they're plausibly just avoiding the wet flat…
it doesn't read as backwards"* and *"local behaviour is right; the global consequence is a
compromise, not a bug."* Both flagged the same honest caveat unprompted, which is the model's,
and it is banked below rather than papered over.

**Verdict: DEEPENED.** The beach now answers both its signals: the sun brings the parasols out,
and the tide decides where they stand.

## Iteration 202 — the twentieth step-back finds a clean city and a lying camera (2026-07-12) [holistic step-back]

**Vector** — holistic step-back (the 20th; 197 was the 19th). No domain lap, no city change: `solvista.html` is
**byte-identical to iter 201**. Two harness probes added.

**Census** — PASS, no page errors, every metric flat (baseline pinned on the same HEAD, so a flat read is the
correct one). Seasons alive: `probe-season` FARM winter→dry-peak **88.4** (the ledger's own expected value),
ROAD control 0.5–2.1.

**Perf — the finding. THE PER-LAP GATE IS STRUCTURALLY BLIND TO COMPOUNDING.**
SKILL.md mandates an interleaved A/B against a *same-session pristine control*, and a step-back sets `REF` to the
previous step-back. Done that way, the last lap is free — and that verdict is *true but useless*:

| REF (step-back) | iters in arc | day | night |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 197 `08cc77b` | 3 (199,200,201) | **+0.4%** | −1.1% |
| 192 `d8819ec` | 10 | +5.2% | +2.1% |
| 177 `7e2ac2c` | 25 | +7.5% | +4.1% |
| 162 `5f01426` | 40 | **+8.6%** | **+5.7%** |

All four measured interleaved against the *same* HEAD, same box, same load. The drift is ~**0.2%/iteration** — which
is *permanently* beneath the noise floor of the 3-iteration A/B the loop is told to run, so every lap can be honestly
graded "free" while the arc costs 8.6%. **A step-back must price the ARC, not the lap.**

To spend that finding you need a SUSPECT, and 198's law says measure it, don't infer it. New
**`probes/probe-drawbudget.mjs`** censuses the whole frame in ONE render, exploiting 198's cost model (the unit of
cost is the **path object rasterized**, so path-object *count* is a cost proxy). It wraps the ctx terminal ops and
attributes each to the artifact fn that issued it (leaf) and to the fn `render()` called (family):

- `drawCell` is **93.8% day / 95.1% night** of all path objects. Entities (vehicles, peds, boats) are a rounding error.
- Day leaves: `prismS` **35.7%** + `bandS` **23.6%** + `hexTile` **17.7%** = **77% in three geometry primitives** —
  i.e. the *static terrain*, re-rasterized every frame although only the light changes.
- Night leaves: `winBandR` **32.6%** — **43,421 path objects from 2,672 `fill()` calls**. That is 198's law made
  visible: batching into one `fill()` does not reduce cost, the ellipses/rects are still rasterized.
- **The proxy is CALIBRATED:** `shadS` (194's tree shadows) = **2.7%** of day path objects, and 197/198 *measured*
  its removal at **−2.8/−3.1%**. Count predicts time.

⇒ **SUSPECT NAMED, FIX NOT MANDATED** (198's law — 197 mandated a fix and burned 198 disproving it). Note the split:
the *drift* lives in the ornament layer the loop keeps adding, but the *mass* (77%) is static terrain that predates
the loop. Clawing back the drift means un-shipping features; the money is somewhere no lap has looked.

**Visual — FOUR agent reads, TWO false FAILs, and BOTH were the instrument, not the city.**
The first pass (shoot.mjs + `?t=`/`?year=`) FAILed on both seeds, both agents independently: *"no sun, the golden
frame renders as NIGHT"* and *"winter is indistinguishable from summer"*. Both were **correct about the pixels and
wrong about the cause** — I had shot the wrong frames:

1. **`t=0.80` is night.** The artifact's own `phaseWord()` returns `'night'` for `t>=0.80`, and `SUNDN=0.78` means the
   sun block *"draws nothing whatever"* past it (its own comment). I guessed the golden-hour pin. Reading `GWARM`
   off the light curve shows it peaks at **0.786 at t=0.70** — golden hour is `[0.55,0.70)`, nowhere near 0.80.
2. **`?year=` DRIFTS.** `playing=true` + `shoot.mjs`'s wait advances `year += dt*speed/6` ≈ **0.167 yr/s** (L7095), so
   the summer pin drifted toward autumn and the *winter* pin drifted into **spring** — which is exactly why an agent
   reported the farmland looked **"inverted"**. This is **iter 139's trap**, which the ledger DOCUMENTED and never
   fixed at source, so the step-back recipe kept telling every iteration to pin with `?year=` anyway.

New **`probes/shot-stepback.mjs`** fixes the camera: freezes the world in-page (`playing=false` → L7092 stops both
clocks), `genWorld`+`__warp`+`__setYear`+`__setTime`+`render()`, no wait, and `page.screenshot()` (DOM-composited,
per 200's law that the user sees canvas **plus** placard). Its pins come from the light curve, not a guess, and each
frame **self-reports** its state (`golden t=0.68 LITAMT=0.28 GWARM=0.72 sun=UP phase=golden hour`).

Re-shot, both seeds **VISUAL: PASS**. The locate-don't-judge check is the proof: two blind agents put the sun at
**(0.386,0.104)** and **(0.39,0.105)**; the shipped formula at `sunP=0.863` gives **(0.388,0.107)** — within 0.003.
Seasons now plainly visible to the agents too (bare ploughed farm, darker/bluer canopy), matching `probe-season`.

**⚠ BANKED CUE (for a Transport/Sky lap, not for tonight).** Both agents, both seeds, unprompted: a long thin dark
line reads as drawn **over** the towers and out across sand/water — *"stray thread"*, *"floating line"*. **The naive
explanation is already DISPROVEN:** `drawMonoAt`/`drawGondAt` are called *inside* the row loop immediately after
`drawCell(x,y)` (L6218–6223), so the aerial lines are row-interleaved and do respect z-order. Real, unexplained,
**and it must be PROBED** — do not redesign on the agents' say-so (108/120's law).
Second, softer cue (both agents): the **golden-hour frame is muddy** — the landmass takes a brown-mauve wash that
flattens colour separation. That is a Sky × Polish target with a ready-made gate (`GWARM`).

**Verdict** — **FIXED** (the harness, not the city). The city itself gets a clean bill: census PASS, seasons alive,
both seeds VISUAL PASS at 3 lights × 2 calendars. The step-back's *own instruments* were producing false FAILs and a
perf gate that could never see its own drift; both are now measured, fixed, and committed as tracked probes.

## Iteration 203 — the thin dark line is a cable, and the cable is fine (2026-07-12) [Transport × Polish, EXPLORED -> REVERTED]

**Vector.** Transport × Polish. Rotation owed Transport (last lap 193), and 202's step-back had
banked an explicit, unexplained cue there: *"a thin dark line reads as drawn OVER the towers/water"*
— seen by **both** agents on **both** seeds, with the naive cause already disproven and an
instruction attached: **PROBE it; do not redesign on the agents' say-so.** A banked, measured
finding outranks kind-rotation, so this lap went to close it.

**What the line IS (`probes/probe-darkline.mjs` — new, and reusable on ANY unexplained linear
artifact).** Wrap `ctx.stroke()`, record each stroke's DEVICE-space polyline length, width and
colour luminance, and attribute it to the issuing fn off the call stack; then census the strokes
that match the description — long, thin, dark. First run was a **false lead**: the top hit was 10
near-vertical 324px strokes from `render:6450` at `lum=0.00`, which turned out to be the **rain
shafts** — my probe defaulted a non-string `strokeStyle` (a `CanvasGradient`) to pure black. The
real answer was hiding *under* the length filter: **the aerial cable-car HAUL ROPE**, stroked
`col('ink',1.05)` = **`#373128`, the darkest ink in the palette, fully opaque, at 0.5 DEVICE px**
at fit zoom. Each span is only 12-14 px — below any sane "long line" threshold — but **15-25 spans
CHAIN into an unbroken 199-331 px dark run** across the sky and the open sea, on all three seeds.
The eye sees the chain; a per-stroke filter cannot. **Cue CLOSED: the line is the cable.**

**The agents' CAUSE was wrong — three ways, and the third is a number.** (1) The girder never
oversteps: `drawMonoAt` strokes only to the **midpoint** of each neighbour, so a beam cannot reach
into another cell's footprint. (2) The rope cannot either: `stepGond` only ever takes `axStep`
d=1 or d=2, and **both are `y+1`**, so a gondola path is **strictly monotone in y** and every span
is drawn BEFORE the row it descends into. (3) And the direct measurement, because a code argument
should not outrank four agent-reads: **`probes/probe-gondz.mjs`** renders the same frame under two
z-orders — rope in its natural place vs. the very same polylines re-stroked on top of the finished
frame — and takes the ink ratio. **OCCLUDED: 22.2/23.6 (seed 42) · 8.6/8.4 (7) · 12.5/12.9% (1234),
day/night.** Not 0%. Later rows genuinely eat 8-24% of the rope. **It is depth-sorted; "painted on
top of everything" is false.** The agents' other claim — *"no cabins on the line, in any frame"* —
is also false: the cabins render at **43-96 px per frame, ~24 px each**, which is exactly a
`prismS(0.11,0.085)` at fit zoom. They are not missing; they are **5 px**.

**What I tried, and why it died.** Give the rope what the girder already got (its own comment at
L5552: the old beam was *"brighter than every building it flew over, and with nothing beneath it"*,
so it was given a body + a lit running surface). The rope is the mirror image and never got the
treatment: a soft translucent **body** so a sub-pixel line antialiases into a rope, a **core** that
is dark but not flat-opaque, and a daylight **glint** (steel catches the sky), gated on `LITAMT`.
**`probes/probe-ropesteel.mjs` refuted it on its own terms:**
- **`glint px: 0 -> 0`, every seed, both lights.** A **DEAD DRAW**. At 0.5 device px the core and
  the highlight land in the **same sub-pixel** — a thin dark line *cannot carry a lit top edge*.
- **`peak contrast: 0.33 -> 0.34` — UNCHANGED**, while coverage rose **419 -> 567 px**. Peak
  contrast is the whole measure of "reads as a hard scratch", and it did not move; the halo made
  the line **more** prominent, the exact opposite of the goal. **A body/halo under a thin dark line
  is additive and works against you** — the only lever that touches peak contrast is the core's own
  alpha/width.

**Census.** PASS. Draw-only: every metric +0, tile histogram empty — correctly vacuous, and it
proves only that the page did not throw. Reverted **byte-identical** (`git diff HEAD` clean), so
perf is unchanged by construction and no perf gate was owed.

**Visual.** 4 agent-reads (2 seeds × fit/mid/close/golden, camera aimed at the rope by
`probes/shot-gondola.mjs`, which LOCATES the longest line and drives the artifact's own
scale/offX/offY — 201's law). All four FAILed, and **all four were wrong about the cause** and
right about the symptom. What survives their reads, and matches the numbers, is a **legibility**
finding, not a z-order or colour one: at fit zoom the whole aerial tramway is **sub-pixel
infrastructure** — a 0.5 px rope, 5 px cabins, hairline masts — so the rope is the only part that
registers at all, and *a lone dark hairline with no legible cars or towers around it reads as a
scratch*. That is **iter 101's law** (`legibility ≈ contrast × width`) landing on Transport.

**Verdict: EXPLORED -> REVERTED.** The cue is CLOSED and the artifact is untouched. The rope is a
legitimate object, correctly depth-sorted, and it must stay visible (the cabins hang from it —
195's orphan law cuts the other way here). Three probes + a camera ship; four laws promoted to
`SKILL.md`. **If a future lap reopens this, it is a `polish-tile`-shaped job on the whole aerial
tramway — rope AND cabins AND masts together, to make it legible as infrastructure — not a tweak
to the rope's colour.** Do not re-try: a halo/body under the rope (measured, backfires), or a lit
top edge on it (measured, impossible at this width).

## Iteration 204 — the service fleet comes home (2026-07-12) [Civic & culture × Connect]

**Vector.** Civic & culture × **Connect** — the coldest cell on the board (last used at iter **45**, ~159
iterations ago), and Civic was the stalest domain (last touched at 195, which explored → reverted). Connect's
trick is that it **adds no new object**: it closes a gap between two that already exist.

**The seam.** Three `CIVICDESC` lines park a vehicle at a door:

- `police` — *"The precinct house. **Cruisers idle in the yard**."*
- `hospital` — *"Emergency, wards, and **the ambulance bay that never closes**."*
- `firehouse` — *"**Engines behind roll-up doors**, ready for the fires on the hill."*

…and `syncFleet` even conditions the **ambulance's very existence** on a hospital standing
(`if(cells.some(c=>c.kind==='hospital'))services.push('ambo')`). The code knows they are related, and then
`stepVehicle` random-walked all three exactly like a car — straightest continuation 72%, else any neighbour —
and **not one of them ever went home.** The fire engine's tooltip said *"Lights on, heading to the smoke"* while
its steering had no idea where the smoke was. This is the label-asserts-what-the-draw-ignores tell, cashed an
8th time, on its richest host yet: **three labels, three vehicles, three buildings, zero connections.**

**Change.** Each service vehicle runs a round trip: it stands at its own institution's door with its beacon
dark, is dispatched **out** to a call, stands there a moment, and drives **home**. It routes by descending a
multi-source BFS field over ROAD cells (`roadField`), so its route *is* the street network and it obeys the
three hex axes for free. `civicDoor(kind)` is ONE definition read by both the dispatcher and the arrival test
(112's law). Each vehicle's call answers its own institution's job, off a field the city already derives: the
cruiser works the **arterials** (`c.flow >= ARTFLOW`, iter 77's "reuse `c.flow` for anything that should follow
the main roads"), the ambulance is called to somewhere people **live**, the engine patrols until something
burns. The **beacon now carries the duty** — an ambulance on a call and an engine at a fire run lit *in
daylight*, anything still out at night runs lit as it always did, and a vehicle standing at its own door is
**dark**. `VKIND`'s `sub` became a **function of the vehicle** (105's law), reading the same `duty` the router
steers by and the beacon lights by: one state, three readers, so they cannot drift apart.

`stepVehicle` runs per **frame** on `Math.random`, so no `rng()` draw is added and the seeded stream — and every
CA pass downstream of it — is byte-identical.

**Census.** PASS. **+0 on every metric, tile histogram empty**, pop/roads/developed all flat. That is the
correct and predicted result for an entity-motion-only change, and it proves only that the page does not throw.
The probe is the gate.

**Probe.** `probes/probe-servcall.mjs` — 240 sim-seconds of stepped entity motion, patch vs pristine HEAD, same
seed, same stubbed `Math.random`. Share of time each vehicle stands **on its own institution's door cell**:

| | HEAD | PATCH |
| --- | --- | --- |
| police | 0.0 / 0.0 / 1.5 % | **20.3 / 20.3 / 17.5 %** |
| fire engine | 0.0 / 1.4 / 0.0 % | **24.6 / 20.5 / 22.0 %** |
| ambulance | 0.0 / 3.3 / 0.0 % | **21.3 / 20.9 / 10.1 %** |
| traffic (control ×38) | 0.4 / 0.2 / 0.1 % | 0.4 / 0.3 / 0.3 % ✓ flat |

2–5 deliberate arrivals each; mean road-distance to home roughly halves. **Forced fire** (the ghost path, lit by
hand because it can never be caught by waiting): the engine's road-distance to the smoke descends **monotonically
56→7 · 42→0 · 66→6** on the three seeds, while HEAD wanders (56→52 · 42→44 · 66→66).

**Visual.** PASS, both seeds. Cruiser located parked at the precinct door (white body, **teal roof bar**, flat on
the hex); ambulance located out on a call with a **lit beacon in daylight** (white body, coral cross, blue/red
flashing square) — a thing the artifact has never done before. Whole-city day and night frames both balanced,
skies correct, nothing compounded.

**Findings.**

1. **The fire CA is a ghost — `probe-firehost` measured it before a line was written, and it saved the vector
   from being born dead.** The original design was "steer the engine at the smoke." Ignition is year-gated
   (blocks `year<2006`, forest `year<2030`), so **at 2035 nothing can ignite at all**; and even in its own era it
   is vanishingly rare — across **3 seeds × 61 years** there are **two one-cell episodes** in the engine's whole
   era (seeds 7 and 1234: *zero*), fire **never spreads** (peak 1.00 cells lit), and a cell burns 4 ticks =
   **1.8 real seconds** while the engine covers **1.6 hexes**. It is `T.MARKET` all over again: fully drawn,
   three labels boasting about it, and it never runs. The engine now genuinely *heads* to the smoke and usually
   never arrives, which is the model being honest. **Do not build "X responds to the fire."**

2. **A parked vehicle is often invisible — and the DOOR is not the reason.** `probe-servbay` measures the parked
   vehicle's ink against the same vehicle re-drawn on top: **4 of 9 read 0%**, eaten by whatever tall thing
   stands in the rows in front (draw order is depth order). I then built a door-ranking lever and **measured it
   at nothing**: nearest / least-blocked-over-3-rows / strictly-in-front score **485 / 489 / 485** out of 900.
   What buries a bay is the **density of the downtown the institution stands in** — the police station happens to
   sit in the open (91–99% on every seed); the hospital and firehouse sit in the core. **The lever was measured
   before it was mandated (198's law) and is not in the shipped code.** Banked as cue (n): making a bay legible
   means giving the civic tile a visible **apron on its front edge** — a `polish-tile` job, like 195's university.

3. **A stubbed shared `Math.random` makes a PER-ENTITY control worthless** — promoted to `SKILL.md`. My first
   control was one car, and it moved (0.0% → 1.4%), which looked like the patch routing ordinary traffic home. It
   was not: the patched service vehicles draw a *different number* of values from the one stubbed stream, so every
   later consumer walks a different walk. Averaged over the whole 38-car fleet the shift washes out and the
   control reads flat. **Aggregate the control, or give it its own stream.**

4. **A frozen clock does NOT refresh the DOM** — promoted to `SKILL.md`. My whole-city night frame came back with
   a *bright daytime sky* over a night-lit plate, and an agent correctly failed it. `syncSky` is **throttled to
   400 ms** and `syncStats` only runs inside the `playing` branch, so a hand-rolled freeze shoots a night plate
   under a day sky. Iter 202's lying camera, walked straight into again, one layer down.

5. **Aim a close-up at the entity's DRAWN position, not its hex centre** — promoted to `SKILL.md`. A vehicle is
   drawn *interpolated* between its hex and its next hex by `v.p`, so `ctr(x,y)` can be a full hex (~110 px)
   from where it actually appears. That is exactly far enough for a visual agent to sweep the wrong quadrant and
   report an empty street — which one did, on a frame where the probe measured the cruiser at **96% visible ink**.
   `stamp()` records the true drawn position in `_sx/_sy`; use it.

6. **The agents disagreed, and the probe was the verdict.** Seed 7 found both vehicles and described them exactly
   (teal roof bar, coral cross, red beacon). Seed 42 reported *"every road hex is completely empty"* — while
   simultaneously describing *"a blue square on a white hexagonal plinth with a coral cross beside it"* and
   calling it a hospital tile. **That is the ambulance**, beacon and all. It looked straight at the feature and
   misnamed it. The probe, which measures precisely the disputed claim (does the vehicle contribute ink to this
   frame), said 96% — and a direct look confirmed it. Agents fail confidently; a number is the verdict.

**Verdict: SHIPPED.**

## Iteration 205 — the ship that was right all along (Water × Connect)

**Vector.** Water & coast × **Connect** — the coldest cell on the whole board (last used at
iteration 22, ~180 laps ago). Connect's trick is that it adds **no new object**: it closes a gap
between two that already exist. The ship, the mole and the harbor works all exist.

**The seam (and it looked textbook).** `genWorld` spawns `freighters[0]` *"at anchor in the
roadstead off the warehouse row, **waiting on a berth**"*, throws a rubble **mole** out across the
roadstead so *"the ship at anchor rides in still water"*, and gives her an `ENTINFO` line saying she
is *"**Serving** the harbor works"*. And then `advanceEntities` says **`if(f.anchored)continue`**.
She has been a **static prop since 1974** — a comment, a breakwater and a tooltip all describing a
job she has never once done. That is the label-asserts-what-the-draw-ignores tell, in 204's exact
shape (the service fleet that never went home), sitting in the coldest cell on the board.

**Change (built, then reverted).** `stepShip()`: lie at anchor → be called **alongside** the quay at
`harborY` → work her boxes off and stow them again (`f.boxes` 6→0→6, the cranes visible in her
silhouette) → stand back out. A wake and a heading while under way; `ENTINFO.sub` a **function** of
her duty (105's law). Zero new draws from *either* random stream — the dwells were respent from her
own `ph` (123's trick) — so the seeded CA could not move and the rest of the shipping stayed
byte-identical.

**Census.** PASS, and **vacuous by construction**: +0 on every metric, tile histogram empty,
`freighters 18` flat. Exactly as predicted for entity motion. (The ±1 wobble on `greenRoofs`/`towerHt`
was checked against **pristine HEAD** and reproduces there — it is the harness's own run-to-run noise,
not the edit.)

**Probe.** `probe-shipberth` PASSED, and **passing was the mistake.** HEAD's ship: motion spread
**0.00 on all 3 seeds** — the static prop, confirmed. PATCH: **4 calls**, ~**55%** of her life
alongside, `minDist 2.9 → 1.60` cells, cargo cycling the full 0..6, and the 5 flooded deep-lane
control ships **bit-identical between builds**. Every number true. Every number irrelevant.

**Visual — the gate that caught it.** Two agents, two seeds, both **FAIL**, both naming the same
thing: *"she is still sitting in open water; there is no quay next to her."* Per the loop's law a FAIL
is a cue to **measure**, so I measured — and they were right. My probe's `ALONGSIDE < 2.2 cells`
threshold was **a number I picked because my own berth constant satisfied it**. The quantity the
*claim* was about is the water the eye sees under her bow, and at `seaXFr(harborY,0)` — the most
inshore position the artifact's open-water projection can even express — that is **54.6px, ~1.7
hexes**, on every seed.

**Why it cannot ship (`probe-harborhost`, 6 seeds, unanimous).** `SHOREX = CTRX+11` is *"the coast
highway column"*. `SHORE0 = SHOREX+5` is the water's edge, *"five lots seaward of the highway"*. The
harbor works are sited at `SHOREX-1-(rng()*3)` — **behind the highway**. So the warehouses stand
**5–9 hexes from the sea**, and the waterline at `harborY` is **BEACH / BEACH / DUNE** on every seed:
the same recreational sand 201 put the parasols and sunbathers on. **There is no quay, no wharf, no
industrial waterfront anywhere in the artifact.** Bringing her alongside beaches a container ship
between the sunbathers and a dune.

⇒ **The ship was never a broken promise.** A **roadstead** is an open anchorage where ships lie at
anchor *precisely because there is nowhere to come alongside*; ships there are worked by lighters or
they wait. *"Waiting on a berth"* is her **situation**, not an unkept one. Solvista is a roadstead,
not a harbour, and I read a real-world intuition ("ships dock") into a model that cannot express
docking — **201's law**, which the header had been carrying for four iterations, aimed straight at me.

**Kept.** `probes/probe-harborhost.mjs` — the host-existence probe (the `probe-market` / `probe-firehost`
shape), so no future lap re-derives this. It runs against plain HEAD and reports the waterline terrain,
the warehouse-to-sea distance, the bow gap, and the 0.00 motion spread, on 6 seeds. New banked cue **(o)**;
`solvista.html` restored **byte-identical** to HEAD.
**Not kept:** `probe-shipberth` (the one quoted above). It diffs the patch against HEAD, and the patch is
gone — it would sit in `probes/` producing a meaningless HEAD-vs-HEAD table forever. A gate for a reverted
change is not a gate. What was worth keeping from it is the *lesson*, and that is now a law in `SKILL.md`.

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED.** The third member of the dead-host family (`T.MARKET` fully drawn and
never sited; the fire CA fully drawn and never ignited; and now the port, fully described and never
built). The *finding* is worth more than the feature would have been: it removes an entire family of
tempting Water vectors from the board and names the one thing that would unlock them — **build the
quay first.**

## Iteration 206 — the gardens the city never dug (2026-07-12) [Nature × New CA rule]

**Vector.** Nature × New CA rule — but the *audit* kind (iter 107's move: rewrite a rule that
never fired, at zero content cost). Rotation owed Nature; the header banked a Nature cue
("GARDEN is the last season-mute tile — Deepen it before a tooltip"). The cue was **right about
the code and wrong about the priority**, and one census read said so: **GARDEN = 6 hexes across
the whole 9-cell matrix**, and the rule is year-gated to 2008+, so that is **~2 per city at 2035
and zero everywhere else**. Deepening a tile you cannot find is beautiful code nobody sees, so
the vector became: *why are there no gardens?* (205's law, cashed one lap later: **check the host
exists before you believe the tell**.)

**The defect (`probes/probe-gardenhost.mjs`, 6 seeds × 4 eras).** The rule wanted
`RES && countAround(...,RES)>=3`. Houses are *not* scarce — the city holds 287–369 RES throughout.
But **a house ringed by houses is precisely the house the upgrade pass turns into a mid-rise**, so
the pool it drew from **collapsed 40 → 15 across the only years the rule was allowed to run**:

```
  2008:  RES 369   host(RES,>=3 RES) 40.2   gardens 0.0
  2015:  RES 387   host             37.7    gardens 0.5
  2025:  RES 349   host             27.7    gardens 0.7
  2035:  RES 287   host             15.2    gardens 1.5     <- seed 5: host 3, gardens 0. Ever.
```

**It is `T.MARKET`'s defect one tile over (107): a siting rule that asks for the condition the
upgrade pass saturates past.** The probe also **killed my own next idea before I wrote it** — the
rule's comment says gardens are dug *"between the houses"* while the code converts a **house**, so
the honest host looked like the vacant lot. It is not: `EMPTY` with ≥2 RES neighbours falls
**85 → 6.5** by 2035 and **with a road adjacent it is 0.0**. The development pass eats every gap.

**Change.** `RES` is the wrong definition of *home* — **a mid-rise is still housing.** New shared
`HOMES = {RES, MID}` (TOWER excluded on purpose: that is skyline, not a neighbourhood), and the
neighbour test counts homes. Pool **2.5×** and *stable* through maturity (85→94→82→41 vs 40→38→27→15);
seed 5's host goes **3 → 30**.

**Then the visual gate FAILed on seed 5 — and it was RIGHT** (2nd time in 3 laps: 200's sun, 205's
ship). Not for its stated reason. It claimed the garden was off-centre and had "no lawn hex"; the
camera was in fact aimed true (`probe-gardenvis.mjs`, centroid **17px** off on an 88px hex). The
truth was worse: **seed 5's garden rendered 0 px of ink against 8,924 px drawn on top — 100%
occluded.** Across 23 gardens: **mean 58% occluded, 7 of 23 ≥86% buried.** A garden sited *in among
the homes* sits behind mid-rises, and **draw order is depth order**. I had stated the claim in
**cells** when it is a claim about **what the eye sees** (205's law, again).

**The lever, measured before mandated (198) — and then measured on the OTHER side.** Front-row
occluders separate cleanly (tall front: 2340px ink, 4/11 buried · clear front: 4354px, 2/12), so I
mandated a hard `openFront()` gate — and **it starved the rule: GARDEN 14 → 5, worse than the bug.**
`HOMES` requires ≥3 home neighbours and `MID` is *both* a home *and* the thing that buries you: the
two predicates fight. So it ships as a **preference, not a gate** — `rng() < (openFront ? 0.075 : 0.02)`
— which is also the in-world rule (nobody digs allotments in the permanent shade of the block next
door). New law in SKILL.md: **a lever has two ledgers — measure its cost to the POPULATION, not just
its effect on the INSTANCE.**

**Census.** PASS, 0 page errors. Core flat: pop −133 (−0.1%), roads +3, developed −23 (−0.4%).
**Tile histogram: `GARDEN 6 → 17` (+11).**

**Probe (`probe-gardenvis.mjs`, 24 gardens / 6 seeds).** mean occluded **58% → 40%** · fully invisible
**1 → 0** · ≥86% buried **7/23 → 1/24** · front-clear share **52% → 71%** · gardens/city **1.5 → 4.0**,
and **no seed is left at zero** (seed 5: 0 → 2, its best rendering **4% occluded, 8363 px**).

**Visual.** PASS on seeds 42 and 5 (seed 5 re-shot after the fix). Both agents, asked to *locate*,
independently reported the mechanism without being told it: *"the taller mid-rises are behind/beside
it rather than in front, so the plot is open to light and clearly visible."* Whole-city frames clean
on both.

**Verdict: FIXED.** A rule that had under-fired for the artifact's entire life now fires, and the
gardens it digs can be seen. **The banked seasonal cue is now UNBLOCKED and worth cashing** — GARDEN's
draw still reads no `year` at all (the last season-mute vegetation tile), and it finally has a host.

**Reusable:** `openFront(x,y)` + `TALLT` (next to `countAround`) — *is the hex in front of this one
clear?* Any ground-level thing that must be SEEN should ask before siting itself; **204's buried
service bays (cue n) are this same defect one domain over.**
