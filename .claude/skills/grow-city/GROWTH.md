# Solvista growth ledger

Append-only log of `grow-city` iterations. Newest at the bottom. Each iteration =
one growth vector, verified by `census.mjs` (numeric, no-regression gate) + a
screenshot pass. This file is the loop's memory: rotate vectors, don't repeat.

Census matrix: seeds `[7, 42, 1234]` × eras `[1985, 2005, 2035]`, `t=0.35`.
Metrics are summed over all 9 cells of the matrix.

## State of the city (maintained header — UPDATE EACH ITERATION)

This grid + the notes below are what step 1 (Orient) reads instead of the whole archive. Cells hold iteration numbers
(**struck = explored and reverted**, so the cell is *attempted*, not *filled* — read its entry before re-trying it);
`U1`–`U5` are user-directed passes (U1 generative monorail · U2 feedback polish · U3 determinism audit · U4 hexagon
plate + plural rivers/monorails/cable cars · U5 census stats that can fall). **Interaction/UX is a column** (since 97);
cross-cutting vectors (U2, 42, U5) stay in the bullets below, not in a cell.

- **Interaction/UX** (inventory + the `<meta charset>` repeal archived at 270; both are INVARIANTS in SKILL.md). What
  steers: when adding an entity array, `stamp()` it in its draw + add an `ENTINFO` row (same discipline as the census
  hook) — `stamp()` also draws the focus ring, so any stamped entity is ringable free. **An `ENTINFO` `sub` may be a
  FUNCTION of the entity (105)** — use it when a thing's interest is its *membership* (line/route/depot), computed live.
- ✅ **THE TRIM METHOD** (paid 279, again 280): a block is cuttable when its **LAW is in SKILL.md** and its **ARTIFACT
  FACTS compress to their imperatives**; a *superseded* warning is free to cut (280's `__setWind` retired 275's).

  **The GAP-CLOSING trick (111/112/113) is SPENT; the TELL that replaced it (a label/name/comment asserting what the

  MOVED ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MARKETING COPY (267): read the placard's claims as a CHECKLIST and ask of each whether the
  rule behind it can fire** — and **268 found the rung BELOW the code: a comment naming a STRUCTURE the value's own

  ⛔ **GARDEN is RETIRED — host starved, see (p).**
  ⚠ 122: a tooltip vector needs a probe checking the claim against INDEPENDENTLY RECOMPUTED truth, not a screenshot.
  **Kind-picking, compressed (full text archived 204/274; menu in SKILL.md).** **Scale** is the coldest kind. **New element**: saturation is of a domain's ENTITIES, so one can still land on a large untouched **SURFACE**. **107 was a New CA rule that ADDED NOTHING** — *auditing an existing rule for reachability* is free in every domain. ⚠ **Nature × Connect is the GRAVEYARD — REVERTED 3x** (46 · 88 · 101); **do not re-open it as a *corridor***. Nature's cold cells are Connect (leave it) and Scale; ⚠ **(ak) is MEASURED-CAPPED — Nature's lap must come from a fresh grep of its seam.**
- **⚠ SCREEN SPACE IS SPOKEN FOR (200 — archived 237; law in SKILL.md).** Probes read `getImageData()` and are **blind
  to the HUD**; `.placard` owns the top-left, `.census`/`.controls` the bottom corners. For a VISIBILITY claim about a
  screen-space draw (`ctx.setTransform(dpr,…)`: sun, moon, stars) diff **`page.screenshot()`**. The open sky is a
  shallow **band** (~0.12 of the viewport) — **do not lower the sun** (cue (s)'s trap).
- **⚠ `peds` CANNOT SERVE THE ROAD NETWORK (111, measured — read before any People vector).** A resident is leashed to
  its anchor (`PEDLEASH=2`, tuned to hold street occupancy at ~19%), so only **20–31%** of bus stops have a live ped's
  anchor within a leash: *"residents walk to / wait at / ride the X"* is structurally capped at ~a quarter of any
  road-borne host. To do it properly move the **spawn pool** (`openCells` in `syncFleet`), not the leash.
- **PERF — `perf-baseline.json` is STALE ON PURPOSE** (pinned 105; it has false-FAILed **ten** step-backs and always
  will — it cannot know today's machine load). Grade a lap by an interleaved A/B/A/B vs the previous step-back
  (`probes/perfab.mjs`, `REF=<sha>`) — **but NEVER by `perfab` ALONE: at 242 the lap timer over-read by ~2x and only
  `probe-drawbudget`'s object count and the ARC could tell** (see the ARC block). **The day column is the NOISY one
  on this box**; night is steady and is the SLOW-accumulating column.
  **COST MODEL + its TWO HOLES: bodies rotated to the archive at 272; the model and its laws are in SKILL.md.** Live:
  **cost is PER PATH OBJECT — the only lever is drawing FEWER objects**; **GRADIENTS and STROKES each come in ~4x over
  the model** (PAID, ACCEPTED, unmeasured) ⇒ **do not shrink a gradient or cull a stroke "because 198 said count is what
  matters"**. (**Never pipe a 2+-round interleave through `tee`** — node block-buffers; run it foreground, long timeout.
  **⚠ `cp` is aliased `-i` — use `/bin/cp`**, iter 147.)
- **`?year=` is a URL hook (108); keyframes `.02/.30/.62/.87` = winter/spring/dry-peak/autumn. Full text (+ 139/202's
  warning that it DRIFTS ~0.167 yr/s while `shoot.mjs` waits — use `probes/shot-stepback.mjs`) is in SKILL.md.**
- **`?tide=` IS A URL HOOK (iter 113) — the sea is testable.** `TIDE` runs a ~2 min seeded cycle. **The default is
  seeded, not neutral — `?seed=42` loads at TIDE 0.02, dead low water.** `?tide=v` shifts the *phase* (`__setTide`).
  Use `.02/.35/.59/.98` = low / mid-ebb / **neutral** / high. **`0.59` is the pin for grading anything ELSE on a marsh**
  (below the flood-sheen cut of 0.60, and `ebb=0` ⇒ the hex body is one flat colour and nothing tidal can move).
- **`c.buzz` — the third derived field, after `c.flow` and `c.val` (iter 104, in `tick()`).** "How much is there to come
  out FOR", seen from a hex: `ATTRACT.has(c.t)?2:0` + a count of `ATTRACT` neighbours. Pure terrain derivation, no
  `rng()`. **Sparse — mean 0.54–0.59 over standable hexes, mostly 0** ⇒ a rule keyed to it is a no-op away from
  attractions. Reuse it for "somewhere worth standing"; don't hand-roll a second. **⚠ `c.buzz` is NOT `PEDDEST`** — an
  attraction field must EXCLUDE the ground you stand on (`PEDDEST`'s argmax is a lawn interior, not a shopfront kerb).
- **The CBD is published: `CBDX`/`CBDY` + `CORER`=16 (iter 98).** ⚠ **`c.val` is NOT a centrality field** — it diffuses
  `valueSrc`, whose peaks sit on **parks and water** (0.92/0.74), not the core. Anything meaning "near downtown" uses
  `hexDist(x,y,CBDX,CBDY)` — never `c.val`, never `CTRX/CTRY` (the plate's centre, which is not the city's).
- **⚠ The plate is a HEXAGON, not a square (U4):** `G` (=67) is only the bounding
  box the `cells` array lives in; the live plate is the `HEXR`=33 rings masked by
  `HEXOK`, and everything outside it is `T.VOID`. So: never loop `0..G` and assume
  a live cell — `inB()` gates it, `cellAt()` returns `null` off-plate, and a seeded
  random cell must come from **`HEXI`** (the live-cell list) or it lands in a dead
  corner. Each row's live span is `ROWMIN[y]`/`ROWMAX[y]`; the coast and its craft
  clamp to those. Per-tick development attempts are scaled by `KS`=1.46 because the
  plate carries ~46% more land than the old 48×48 square — a new per-tick placement
  loop should scale with `ks(n)` too, or it will fill proportionally slower.
- **⚠ Monorail and cable cars are PLURAL (U4):** `monos` / `gonds` are *lists* of
  independently grown lines, each closing its own loop. The old singular `monorail`,
  `monoPath`, `monoClosed`, `gond`, `gondPath` are gone — code written against them
  will silently read `undefined`.
- **Traffic flow exists — `c.flow` + `ARTFLOW` (iter 77; body archived at 241).** `trafficFlow()` drains trips down
  the road network like a drainage tree; `flow>=ARTFLOW` (64) is an **arterial** (~15% of roads). It is a **network**
  measure, unlike the *local* `busy`. **Reuse `c.flow` for anything that should follow the main roads** — don't
  hand-roll a second; `__find` answers `'arterial'`. ⚠ **But flow is a bad host for *land use* (82):** `RES→COM` on
  arterial frontage came out 85% **singletons** (by the time a street carries flow its frontage is already
  COM/MID/TOWER). Flow suits *point* decisions, not *linear* ones. **Don't re-try it.**
- **Institutions cluster: `MAJORK` / `QUARTER` / `siteQuarter()` (91; detail archived at 200/241).** `MAJORK` = the five
  monumental kinds — the shared vocabulary for "major institution", read by BOTH the civic quarter and the 2020+
  forecourt rule. `QUARTER` = the three that *seek* it; `observatory` is deliberately free to sit at the rim.
  `siteQuarter()` hugs the nearest standing major at **2-4 hexes**.
- **Open cues, banked by holistic passes (take one when its domain comes up):**
  **(g) ~SIXTEEN seedless `hashCell` calls paint the IDENTICAL pattern in EVERY city** (body archived at 281).
  ⚠ **RE-RUN the audit, never a catalogue** (L-numbers drift): `grep -noE 'hashCell\([^;]{0,60}' solvista.html | grep -v
  seedNum`. **Only PRESENCE decisions are a breach worth a vector**; the **night surf light-smear** (`hashCell(x,y,77)
  <0.28`) is the one to fix. ⚠ **`darkWinR` is NOT a breach — check the callee.** When fixing a range, **space the bases**.

## Iteration 335 — forty-six laps on, the water still reads as water (2026-07-17) [44th step-back / holistic]

**Vector.** The header pointed here explicitly: "STEP-BACK #43 DONE @330 — NEXT ~335." Five laps have landed since #43
(331 jet+contrail, ~~332 chimney smoke REVERTED~~, 333 fire-smoke lean, 334 sail belly), the last three a cross-cutting
WINDA-enumeration run. A step-back is the guardrail that lets the loop run unattended: the census catches *metric*
collapse but is blind to *cumulative visual* drift and to *permanent perf* drift, so both are measured here, not vibed.

**Census + error gate.** Clean HEAD (5967acb, through 334), tree clean. `census.mjs` VERDICT PASS, 0 page errors; core
`pop`/`developed`/`roads` unmoved, only the usual ±1 chaotic wobble on `solarRoofs`/`greenRoofs`/`towerHt`.

**Visual (whole-frame, 3 lights × 2 calendars × 2 seeds, `shot-stepback.mjs`, clock frozen in-page, pins DERIVED from
the light curve — 264).** One blind subagent per seed, asked the *cumulative* question (has anything compounded into
clutter/darkness), not "is a feature present." Both seeds independently PASS:
- **City coherent & balanced** across all frames — dense towers inland → mid ring → farms/parks → beach/pier coastline,
  reads as one California coastal city; **no wallpaper band, no over-busy district, no compounded clutter or darkness,
  no blown-out colour.**
- **No z-order tears, floating tiles, or detached glows** anywhere — pier, Ferris wheel, offshore windmills, buoys all
  sit correctly on the water; tower stacking clean in the lit night frames.
- **Day-length season reads on BOTH seeds** (261): summer-dusk is warm golden with the sun still up over a teal sea;
  winter-dusk, the SAME wall-clock instant, is night-dark with the crescent moon risen and windows lit — sun provably
  SET in winter, UP in summer (a discriminating pair, 264, resolved blind on both seeds).
- **Night coast is coherent lit-city-and-water** — deep blue sea, pier/wheel glow, red/green channel buoys, shore
  lamps, the built mass glowing warm — not a flat void (the kelp/coast-darkening class stays closed, 282).

**Perf (permanent arc, priced in PATH OBJECTS — load-immune, 198/216 — with `c.snow` cleared per 325's law, so `__warp(61)`'s
seasonal snow is not misattributed to the perm arc).** `probe-drawbudget.mjs` mean of 3 seeds, day / night path objects:
- iter 285 (b523698): 110256 / 138143 · iter 330 (9e944af): 111517 / 139941 · **HEAD 334: 111670 / 139870.**
- **Long arc vs 285 (49 laps): day +1.28% (+0.026%/lap), night +1.25% (+0.026%/lap)** — well under the +0.2%/lap the arc
  used to run at (162→202 cost 8.6% over 40 laps), and consistent with the standing fact that the run's byte-flat FIXES
  cancel its additive tendency.
- **Recent arc vs 330 (4 laps): day +0.14% (+0.034%/lap), night −0.05%** — flat; the last five laps were draw-only WINDA
  deepens (one extra `windForce()` term each, zero new path objects), so nothing to fix. **No perf-fix lap.**

**Verdict: STEP-BACK — NO DRIFT.** City healthy and beautiful across 3 lights × 2 seasons on 2 seeds; day-length season
alive; night ordering / golden-greens / sea-quilt facts hold (standing facts, unre-measured this lap because no lap
since #43 touched their surfaces); permanent draw arc negligible (+0.026%/lap, snow-excluded) with the recent window
flat. Guardrail reset — next vector ~340 is a measured seam (225) or a Deepen/Polish/Interaction in a rotated domain
(avoid Sky/Water; additive space is spent, 331, and remaining gaps are deep-but-invisible-at-zoom — price visibility,
266, before building). Nothing to fix.

## Iteration 336 — the shopfront crowd comes in from the rain (2026-07-17) [People & activity × Deepen/interconnect]

**Vector.** Step-back #44 just landed (335); the header points to a **measured seam (225)** or a Deepen in a rotated
domain (avoid Sky/Water). I ran the header's own #1 seam-finders and confirmed the loud signals are tended: the WINDA
readers (enumerated 333/334), the rain readers (ped umbrellas + beach umbrellas + washing line), TIDE, the night-hours
that thin cars/bikes/trams/peds/kids/joggers, the type-keyed tables (274/281/285/288), and the **frozen census tile
histogram** (every flat/zero row is terrain or a landmark — LIGHTHOUSE/MARSH/ROCK/SHOREPARK/VOID; SOLARF fixed at 287;
SHOREPARK hosts live CAs so its flat count is correct). But grepping the rain MECHANISM (`rainingAt`, not the comment's
noun list — 280) turned up three un-enumerated siblings of the exact category a recent lap enumerated the washing line
into (its comment cites 271/286): the **park café/kiosk patrons** (`drawCell` PARK, `LITAMT<0.5`), the **busker**
(`buskerAt`, `nightAmt()<buskOut`), and the busker's **evening strip audience** (`drawBuilding` COM, `nightAmt()<
stripOut`). All three keep an HOUR and ignored the SHOWER — an outdoor terrace/pavement crowd that sits through a
downpour. This is 262/271's cliff exactly (fix one member of a category, leave its siblings — here the sibling *is* in
the file, one and two functions from a fix that just shipped) and it is VISIBLE: the strip crowd is one of the broadest
night populations, so it clears the visibility bar (266) that the remaining bad-trade candidates (fountains ~1.4px,
whale spout, chimney smoke 332) do not.

**Change (draw-only — no `rng()`, no terrain).** A shared predicate `dryAt(x,y)=rainingAt(x,y)<RAINDRY` (`RAINDRY=0.05`,
the same low come-inside cutoff the washing line already read — distinct from `RAINUMB=0.25`, the umbrella-UP threshold),
`&& dryAt(x,y)` added to the café-patron gate, `buskerAt`, and the strip-crowd gate, and the **washing line repointed**
to it (ONE predicate, N readers — 112, so they cannot drift). At `rainingAt<0.05` (dry — the overwhelming majority of
hexes/time) `dryAt` is true and every gate collapses to HEAD's condition **byte-for-byte**: an exact fixed point
(245/253), so DRY ≡ HEAD and no HEAD file is needed to prove it.

**Census.** Draw-only ⇒ tile histogram empty, `pop`/`developed`/`roads` **byte-identical (+0)**, 0 page errors. VERDICT
PASS. Only the usual ±1 tick-timing wobble on `solarRoofs`/`greenRoofs`/`towerHt` (226 — not mine; no `rng()`/terrain).

**Probe** (`probes/probe-cafehours.mjs`, build-agnostic — grades the SHIPPED draw in ONE build, ONE world, ONE frame:
stubs `window.rainingAt` (a function declaration ⇒ on window) to 0 (DRY ≡ HEAD) and to 1 (WET, raining everywhere) and
counts the body `fillRect`s the frame ISSUES by their (w,h) signature — no pixel diff, NO NOISE FLOOR AT ALL). The
strip's 1.6×2.6 body shares its signature with a rain-independent draw (visible: DAY-frame strip = the collision floor,
where `LITAMT>0.35` forbids the strip crowd), so per 285 the **DELTA** dry→wet is the measurement. All 3 seeds:
- **café 173/228/172 · busker 17/15/24 · strip 234/273/248 come IN** when wet (delta > 0), and the strip's WET residual
  returns exactly to its rain-independent floor (the strip crowd itself hit 0).
- **kid control (drawPed 1.2×1.8) IDENTICAL dry vs wet** — the must-not-move column held (250), so the rain stub moved
  only the three intended draws.
- **DRY == HEAD by construction** (dryAt≡true collapses each gate — the exact fixed point). **CAFEHOURS: PASS.**

**Visual** (`probes/shot-cafehours.mjs` — same frozen dusk city (2035, dry-peak, dayT=0.82 so the strips are neon-lit
and out), shot DRY (`rainingAt→0`, ≡HEAD, busy) and WET (`rainingAt→1`, emptied) as a blind A/B zoomed 4× on the CBD
strips; `page.screenshot` (200); tokens meaningless + non-ordinal, map **CROSSED between seeds** (238/239/268); md5
confirmed the pairs differ). **Both blind subagents, on both seeds, on the crossed map, correctly named the busy (DRY)
frame from the crowd density alone** (s42 dry=`orla` ✓ · s7 dry=`pike` ✓ — a discriminating pair, 264, resolved blind
on both): the dry frame has more standing/seated figures on the striped awning strips and café terraces; the wet frame
has those spots bare (the crowd gone indoors). Both confirmed **no z-order tears, floating tiles or blown-out colour**
anywhere, and the whole-city dusk frame reads as a **balanced, coherent coastal city** — glowing CBD, parks/rivers,
legible beach/pier/wind-farm coastline, crescent moon.

**Perf.** Zero new path objects (draw-only; three gates gain one `dryAt()` term each, the washing line's byte-identical
repoint). Step-back (~340) prices the arc.

**Verdict: SHIPPED.** The outdoor shopfront/kerb crowd — café diners, the busker, its evening strip audience — now
comes in from a passing shower on the same `dryAt` predicate the washing line reads, and stands out unchanged when dry
(exact fixed point). The rain-aware category's last visible siblings are enumerated (271/286/280); the remaining rain
sibling is the beach crowd, which is Water and calendar-only by design (⛔ do not force). Draw-only, census
byte-identical. People × Deepen. `probes/probe-cafehours.mjs`, `probes/shot-cafehours.mjs`.

## Iteration 337 — the picnic and the pickup game come in from the rain too (2026-07-17) [People & activity × Deepen/interconnect]

**Vector.** 336 brought the shopfront/kerb crowd in from a shower and wrote into the header that "the rain-aware
category's LAST VISIBLE siblings are enumerated." It was not — and the missed siblings were the two clearest outdoor
DAYTIME crowds, sitting in the SAME draw code 336 had just edited: the park **picnickers** (`drawCell` PARK v<0.44 —
a blanket + a seated family on the lawn), **twenty lines below** the café patrons 336 DID give `dryAt`; and the pickup
**ballgame** on a sports pitch (`drawCell` FIELD, gated on `pitchGame(x,y)>0`). Both keep an HOUR (`LITAMT<0.5`, day)
and a season (the picnic packs away for winter), but ignored the SHOWER — a family picnicking and kids playing ball
through a downpour, while the café terrace beside them had just been brought in. This is 262/286's cliff exactly
(fix one member of a category, leave the sibling in the same function) and a *visible incoherence now sitting next to
336's own frame*. Found by grepping the outdoor-daytime-crowd draws (`LITAMT<0.5` gates) for the rain predicate they
lack — not the header's noun list (280), whose "last sibling = the beach crowd" claim was the tell.

**Change (draw-only — no `rng()`, no terrain).** `&& dryAt(x,y)` added to the picnic gate; and folded **into**
`pitchGame(x,y)` (`if(!dryAt(x,y))return 0;` at the top) so the ONE predicate answers for the draw AND the tooltip
(`pitchWord`, 112/123) — the tooltip can no longer claim "a pickup game is on" over an empty rained-off pitch. No new
constant (the existing `dryAt` = `rainingAt<RAINDRY`, 0.05). At `rainingAt<0.05` (dry — the overwhelming majority of
hexes/time) `dryAt` is true and both gates collapse to HEAD byte-for-byte: an exact fixed point (245/253), so DRY ≡ HEAD.

**Census.** Draw-only ⇒ tile histogram empty, `pop`/`developed`/`roads` **byte-identical (+0)**, 0 page errors. VERDICT
PASS. Only the usual ±1 tick-timing wobble on `solarRoofs`/`greenRoofs`/`towerHt` (226 — matched HEAD's own baseline run
before the edit; not mine, no `rng()`/terrain).

**Probe** (`probes/probe-parkrain.mjs`, build-agnostic — grades the SHIPPED draw in ONE build, ONE world, ONE frame:
stubs `window.rainingAt` (a function declaration ⇒ on window) to 0 (DRY ≡ HEAD) and to 1 (WET everywhere) and counts
the body `fillRect`s the frame ISSUES by their (w,h) signature — picnic blanket 5.2×2.6, pitch player 1.6×2.4, kid
control 1.2×1.8. No pixel diff, NO NOISE FLOOR.). Afternoon pin (dayT=0.60: `LITAMT<0.5` and inside the kickoff window),
2035.62 dry peak. All 3 seeds:
- **picnic 16/24/31 · pitch 8/40/24 come IN** when wet — and the WET count is **exactly 0** for both (no rain-independent
  collision on these signatures), so the whole crowd cleared.
- **kid control IDENTICAL dry vs wet** — the must-not-move column held (250); the rain stub moved only the two draws.
- **DRY == HEAD by construction. PARKRAIN: PASS.**

**Visual** (`probes/shot-parkrain.mjs` — same frozen afternoon dry-peak city, shot DRY (`rainingAt→0`, ≡HEAD, crowds
out) and WET (`rainingAt→1`, emptied) as a blind A/B zoomed 5× and **aimed by measured ink** (226/272: the only thing
differing between DRY and WET is the picnic/ballgame crowds, so the argmax of the DRY-vs-WET diff IS where they render,
HUD boxes zeroed first — 200), plus a whole-city DRY frame; tokens meaningless + non-ordinal, map **CROSSED between
seeds** (238/239/268); md5 confirmed the pairs differ). **Both blind subagents, on both seeds, on the crossed map,
correctly named the busy (DRY) frame from the lawn/pitch crowd alone** (s42 dry=`wren` ✓ · s7 dry=`lark` ✓): picnic
blankets + ballgame player-specks on the green lawns/chalk pitches in DRY, those exact spots BARE in WET (only the
umbrella-carrying peds remain — a different, correctly-still-present category). Both confirmed the crowds sit ON the
lawns/pitches (not floating/on road/water), and the whole-city frame reads as a **balanced, coherent coastal city** —
no z-order tears, floating tiles, or blown-out colour.

**Perf.** Zero new path objects (draw-only; the picnic gains one `dryAt()` term, `pitchGame` one early-out). Step-back
(~340) prices the arc.

**Verdict: SHIPPED.** The park's daytime crowds — a lawn picnic and a pickup ballgame — now come in from a passing
shower on the same `dryAt` predicate as the café crowd, and stand out unchanged when dry (exact fixed point). 336's
"last visible rain sibling is the beach crowd" was wrong; with these two the outdoor-daytime-crowd category is closed
for real (the beach crowd remains the sole hold-out, Water and calendar-only by design ⛔). Draw-only, census
byte-identical. People × Deepen. `probes/probe-parkrain.mjs`, `probes/shot-parkrain.mjs`.

## Iteration 338 — the capitol's standards fly with the wind (2026-07-17) [Civic & culture × Deepen/interconnect]

**Vector.** The parliament — "the seat of the region, and the tallest civic roof in Solvista" — flies twin gold
standards from its dome front. Every OTHER flag in the city rides the shared gust (the hall's and school's `windFlag`
scale their flutter by `WINDA`; the harbour + beach flags; the kites read `kiteGust`; smoke leans on `smokeLean`; the
sails belly on `windForce` — 280/333/334), and 280 wrote the law that they must all "gust together". But the capitol's
two most prominent flags flapped on `Math.sin(time*2+y)` — a clock term with **no wind in it** — so they snapped stiffly
straight out in a **dead calm** while the hall flag on the next roof hung limp. They are the un-enumerated member of the
wind's reader category (280: the reader list is a changelog, not a spec — grep the MECHANISM `windForce`, not the header's
"wind DONE ⛔"). Found by grepping every flag/pennant draw for `windForce`/`WINDA` and finding the one inline draw
(`drawCivic`'s parliament branch, ~L8388) that a `windFlag`-caller grep misses. Rotated off People (336/337 both rain)
into Civic; a different KIND (wind, not rain) and domain.

**Change (draw-only — no `rng()`, no terrain, unreachable from `tick()`).** `wf2=windForce()`; each standard's downwind
reach `st=(4.2+wv2)*(0.34+0.66*wf2)` streams farther/flatter in a gale and shrinks in the lull, plus a droop
`dp=2.4*(1-wf2)` that hangs it in toward the pole when the air goes still, in the SAME +x every gusting thing drifts.
At `windForce()==1` (full gale) `st=4.2+wv2, dp=0` ⇒ **HEAD's exact `4.2+wv2` byte-for-byte** — an exact fixed point
(245/280, the kite convention: 1.0 at full gale = HEAD). Same two `fill()`s, same primitives ⇒ zero new path objects.

**Census.** Draw-only ⇒ tile histogram empty, `pop`/`developed`/`roads` **byte-identical (+0)**, 0 page errors.
VERDICT PASS.

**Probe** (`probes/probe-capitolflag.mjs`, build-agnostic — hooks the artifact's own path ops and reads back the
pennant triangle the frame ISSUES (base verts share the pole x, tip offset `+st`), so reach = `tipX-baseX` is
deterministic with **NO NOISE FLOOR AT ALL**; `windForce` is a top-level function ⇒ `window.windForce=()=>1` renders
HEAD's draw IN-PAGE (253), so ONE file grades HEAD and the patch, no source swap, no cross-build floor). 4 seeds
(42/7/1234/99), 1 parliament each, mean of the 2 standards' reach at day pin, frozen clock:
- **RESPONSE:** CALM (`WINDA=0.25`, `windForce=0`) reach is **0.34x** the GALE (`WINDA=1.0`) reach on all 4 seeds
  (3.23→1.10 · 3.89→1.32 · 4.39→1.49 · 5.13→1.74) — the standard clearly answers the wind.
- **FIXED POINT:** GALE reach == HEAD reach **exactly** on every seed (windForce==1 reproduces HEAD's `4.2+wv2`).
- **CONTROL / must-not-move (250):** HEAD (windForce stubbed to 1) reads the **identical** reach at `WINDA=0.25` and
  `WINDA=1.0` — HEAD ignores the wind, so nothing but the patched lever moved. CAPITOLFLAG: PASS.

**Visual** (`probes/shot-capitolflag.mjs` — same frozen world, ONE parliament, shot at `__setWind(0.25)` (calm) and
`__setWind(1.0)` (gale) as a blind A/B zoomed 7× and centred on the capitol via `zoom`/`offX` (269), plus an un-zoomed
whole-city gale frame; `page.screenshot` DOM-composited (200); tokens meaningless + non-ordinal, calm/gale map
**CROSSED between seeds** (238/239/268); md5 confirmed all 4 zoomed frames differ). **Both blind subagents, on both
seeds, on the crossed map, correctly named the GALE from the streaming standards alone** (s42 gale=`cobalt` ✓ · s7
gale=`myrtle` ✓): pennants stream out flat/far to the right in the gale, hang short/drooped against their poles in the
calm, attached to the poles on the building (not floating/detached), no z-order tears or blown colour anywhere, and
both whole-city frames read as a balanced, coherent coastal city.

**Perf.** Zero new path objects (draw-only, same 2 fills). Step-back (~340) prices the arc.

**Verdict: SHIPPED.** The capitol's twin standards now fly with the same gust as every other flag, kite, plume and
sail — the whole sky, the seat of the region included, gusts together (280). Exact fixed point at full gale, census
byte-identical. Civic × Deepen. `probes/probe-capitolflag.mjs`, `probes/shot-capitolflag.mjs`.

## Iteration 339 — the festival strand stirs in the wind too (2026-07-17) [Civic & culture × Deepen/interconnect]

**Vector.** 338 wired the capitol's standards to the shared gust and wrote "WIND-READER CATEGORY CLOSED" into the
header. It was not — and the missed member was the most emphatically *festive* draw in the city: the **bunting**,
strung along the civic-mile festival strand (`c.fete`, ~L6974) and around the **civic square** (a park cell beside a
CIVIC, ~L6348). Every other cloth thing over this coast gusts together (280: the flags flap, kites fly, sails belly,
smoke leans on `windForce`) — but the one element strung up *expressly to be festive* hung as **frozen dead-straight
pennants on a fixed catenary**, on 6 seeds in 6, in any wind, for the artifact's whole life. Found by grepping every
flag/pennant/cloth draw against the MECHANISM `windForce` (280 — not the header's "wind DONE ⛔" noun-list, which is
the tell 336/337 already walked into: a "category closed" claim is a changelog, not a spec). Rotated off People
(336/337) and the fresh capitol lap (338); a coherence fix on a distinct host (a whole-strand catenary, not a pole
flag) in a domain the same lap just touched but on the *opposite* seam.

**Change (draw-only — no `rng()`, no terrain, unreachable from `tick()`).** Both strands take `wf=windForce()`. The
string sag lifts in a gust (`2.6*(1-0.5*wf)` / `2.4*(1-0.5*wf)` — a deep limp catenary in a calm, taut in a gale) and
each pennant tip streams downwind and lifts (`tip=(qx+3.5*wf, qy+2.2*(1-0.6*wf))`, +x = the way every gusting thing
drifts east). **Fixed point at DEAD CALM, not gale** — HEAD draws the bunting in its *limp/rest* state (pennants
straight down), so `windForce()==0` (i.e. `WINDA<=0.25`) reproduces HEAD byte-for-byte (245); the opposite end of
280's kite convention, because HEAD's frozen draw is the calm state here, not the gale one. Same two `fill()`s per
pennant ⇒ zero new path objects.

**Census.** Draw-only ⇒ tile histogram empty, `pop`/`developed`/`roads` **byte-identical (+0)**, 0 page errors. VERDICT PASS.

**Probe** (`probes/probe-bunting.mjs`, build-agnostic — hooks the artifact's own path ops and reads back each pennant
TRIANGLE the frame ISSUES (top edge two verts 2px apart at one y; the 3rd is the tip), so tip STREAM (`tipX-mid`) and
DROP are deterministic with **NO NOISE FLOOR AT ALL**; `windForce` is a top-level function ⇒ `window.windForce=()=>0`
renders HEAD's draw IN-PAGE (253), ONE file grades HEAD and the patch, no source swap). 4 seeds (42/7/1234/99),
120–230 bunting pennants each, day pin, frozen clock:
- **RESPONSE:** GALE stream **3.50px** vs CALM **0.00px**; GALE drop **0.88** vs CALM **2.20** — the pennants clearly
  stream downwind and lift in a gale, on all 4 seeds.
- **FIXED POINT:** CALM (`WINDA=0.25`, `windForce=0`) == HEAD **exactly** (stream 0.00, drop 2.20).
- **CONTROL / must-not-move (250):** HEAD (`windForce=>0`) reads the identical stream/drop at `WINDA=0.25` and `1.0` —
  HEAD ignores the wind, so nothing but the patched lever moved. BUNTING: PASS.

**Visual** (`probes/shot-bunting.mjs` — same frozen world shot at `__setWind(0.25)` (calm) and `__setWind(1.0)` (gale)
as a blind A/B zoomed 9× and **aimed by the bunting's OWN ink** (a whole-scene calm-vs-gale diff is contaminated by
every other wind reader — trees, sea, kites, clouds — so it hooks the pennants and centres on the densest 50–55-pennant
strand cluster, 226/272), plus an un-zoomed whole-city gale frame; `page.screenshot` DOM-composited (200); tokens
meaningless + non-ordinal, calm/gale map **CROSSED between seeds** (238/239/268); md5 confirmed all 4 zoomed frames
differ). **Both blind subagents, on both seeds, on the crossed map, correctly named the GALE from the streaming bunting
alone** (s42 gale=`harebell` ✓ · s7 gale=`harebell` ✓): pennants stream/lift to the right along a taut string in the
gale, hang straight down on a deeper-sagging string in the calm ("subtle but consistent across all four bunting
locations"). Both confirmed the pennants sit attached ON the string (not floating), no z-order tears or blown colour,
and both whole-city frames read as balanced, coherent coastal cities.

**Perf.** Zero new path objects (draw-only, same 2 fills per pennant, each gains one `windForce()` term). Step-back
(~340) prices the arc.

**Verdict: SHIPPED.** The festival bunting — the civic mile's strand and the square's — now lifts and streams with the
same gust as every flag, kite, plume and sail; the whole festive city gusts together (280). Exact fixed point at dead
calm (HEAD = limp bunting), census byte-identical. Civic × Deepen. `probes/probe-bunting.mjs`, `probes/shot-bunting.mjs`.

## Iteration 340 — forty-seven laps on, the water still reads as water (2026-07-17) [45th step-back / holistic]

**Vector.** The header pointed here explicitly ("~340 = STEP-BACK #45"). Five laps have landed since #44 @335
(336/337 rain-aware crowds, 338/339 festival-cloth wind), all draw-only Deepens. A step-back is the guardrail that lets
the loop run unattended: the census catches *metric* collapse but is blind to *cumulative visual* drift and to
*permanent perf* drift, so both are measured here, not vibed.

**Census + error gate.** Clean HEAD (8c34523, through 339), tree clean. `census.mjs` VERDICT PASS, 0 page errors; core
`pop`/`developed`/`roads` byte-unmoved, only the usual chaotic ±wobble (`solarRoofs +2`).

**⚠ GWARM=0 SELF-REPORT — CHASED, RESOLVED AS CORRECT (not drift).** `shot-stepback`'s frames self-reported
`GWARM=0` at the `golden` and `dusk` pins on BOTH seeds, which is the 264/265 tell (a golden frame shot at GWARM≈0 is
shooting the control). Measured it out: GWARM (`clamp((skyBot.R−skyBot.B−70)/70,0,1)`) needs skyBot R−B>70, and the raw
`KEYS` sunset skyBot (`#e89a6b`=[232,154,107], R−B=125) gives **GWARM 0.786** — the machinery is alive. It reads 0 at the
pinned years because **`overcast()` greys skyBot BEFORE GWARM reads it** (L9348, "a storm mutes the golden sheen"), and
the pinned dry peak **2035.62 lands on a rain front** (`overcast=0.576`, `rainFront=0.819`; every warp-year 2035–2036 was
overcast ≥0.35). In the clearest nearby year (2034, overcast=0) GWARM peaks **0.6**. So GWARM is CORRECT, not dead.
⚠ **Instrument caveat for the next step-back (do NOT re-chase this):** `shot-stepback` DERIVES the golden pin on a fresh
page with NO `genWorld`/weather (clear sky, GWARM peaks ~0.78) but SHOOTS the frame in the WARPED overcast world — so its
`golden`/`dusk` frames are muted overcast dusks and their `GWARM=0` is honest about the *frame*. Longstanding fixed-pin
property (same across #42–#44). A future tool tweak could derive the golden pin in the same warped world, or pin golden
to a clear year; not fixed this lap (step-back does not chain a tool rewrite).

**Visual (whole-frame, 3 lights × 2 calendars × 2 seeds, `shot-stepback.mjs`, clock frozen in-page).** One blind
subagent per seed, cumulative question. Both seeds independently **PASS**:
- **City coherent & balanced** across all frames — dense inland towers → mid-rise ring → farm/park belt → beach/pier/sea
  — reads as one California coastal city; no wallpaper band, no over-busy district gone muddy, nothing blown-out.
- **No z-order tears, floating tiles, or detached glows** — pier steps out cleanly, Ferris wheel grounded on the pier,
  offshore windmills on their water hexes, towers stack clean, rail/power/bridges connect end-to-end.
- **Seasonal discriminating pair resolves blind on BOTH seeds** (264): dusk-summer sun UP (light overcast, lit scene),
  dusk-winter — SAME instant — sun DOWN (dark navy, crescent moon + stars, lit windows). Sun provably set in winter, up
  in summer.
- **Night coast coherent lit-city-and-water** — warm window grids, street/rail lamps, red/green buoys, moon on deep-blue
  water, lit pier — not a flat void (kelp/coast-darkening class stays closed, 282).
- **Watch item (soft, seed-7 aside, not a FAIL):** the inland tower core is *approaching* over-busy — do NOT add raw
  tower density downtown (echoes the standing "no wallpaper / crown-not-picket" family, 217/224/228).

**Perf (permanent arc, PATH OBJECTS — load-immune, 198/216 — snow cleared per 325).** `probe-drawbudget.mjs` mean of 3
seeds, day / night:
- iter 285 (b523698): 110327 / 138117 · iter 335 (5b2c762): 111698 / 139754 · **HEAD 339: 111551 / 139902.**
- **Long arc vs 285 (54 laps): day +1.11% (+0.021%/lap), night +1.29% (+0.024%/lap)** — well under +0.2%/lap, consistent
  with byte-flat FIXES cancelling the additive tendency.
- **Recent arc vs 335 (4 laps): day −0.13%, night +0.11%** — flat; 336–339 were draw-only rain/wind deepens (one extra
  predicate term each, zero new path objects). **No perf-fix lap.**

**Verdict: STEP-BACK — NO DRIFT.** City healthy and beautiful across 3 lights × 2 seasons on 2 seeds; day-length season
alive; golden-hour warmth machinery verified alive (0.6–0.78 clear-sky, muted by overcast at the pinned years, not a
regression); night ordering / golden-greens / sea-quilt facts hold (unre-measured — no lap since #44 touched their
surfaces). Permanent draw arc negligible (+0.02%/lap). Guardrail reset — next vector ~341 is a measured seam (225) or a
Deepen/Polish/Interaction in a rotated domain (avoid Sky/Water; additive space spent, 331; price visibility, 266, before
building). Nothing to fix.

## Iteration 341 — the wet streets mirror their lamps (2026-07-17) [Transport × Deepen/interconnect]

**Vector.** Step-back #45 (@340) pointed here: a measured seam (225) or a Deepen in a rotated domain,
avoid Sky/Water (and People/Civic just ran, 336–339). I ran the header's seam-finders — the frozen census
tile histogram (every flat/zero row is audited terrain/landmark), the type-keyed tables, the per-cell flag
lifecycles (`corner`/`loft`/`solar`/`groof`/`hstr`/`bridge`/`riv` — all ride or are consumed correctly, 288
being the last), the season/crop calendars (farms/orchards/vineyards fully deepened), and the animate mono-gate
cliffs (300 was the last). All closed — the artifact is deeply saturated. The one genuinely-open seam: **the
rain MECHANISM (rainingAt) had no reader on the ROADS.** The arterial spine + ordinary streets draw warm lamp
pools at night (`drawCell` ROAD, `LITAMT>0.25`, ~L6918) but gleamed **identically wet or dry** — the wet-street
reflection (why a rainy city night reads luminous; the land analog of 329's waterfront-reflects-the-skyline) was
missing. Found by grepping the MECHANISM `rainingAt` (280 — not the header's "rain readers enumerated" noun list,
which 336/337 already walked into): its readers were all crowds/umbrellas/washing — never a road surface.

**Change (draw-only — no `rng()`, no terrain, unreachable from `tick()`).** In the night-lamp block, `const
wetg=rainingAt(x,y)`; when `wetg>0` each lamp head draws one extra warm radial-gradient smear, vertically
stretched toward the viewer (`translate(cx,cy+1.5); scale(0.55,2.6)`), alpha `WETGLEAM*LITAMT*wetg` — the arterial
gleam at `WETGLEAM=0.42`, the ordinary street at ×0.7. A reflection is a LONG mark, so it survives the downscale
to fit zoom where a flat wash would not (266). At `rainingAt===0` (the dry majority of hexes/time) the `if(wetg>0)`
block is skipped, so a dry frame draws HEAD's exact bytes — an **exact fixed point** (245/253): DRY ≡ HEAD, no HEAD
file needed. Same lamps otherwise ⇒ zero new path objects when dry.

**Census.** Draw-only ⇒ tile histogram empty, `pop`/`developed`/`roads` **byte-identical (+0)**, 0 page errors.
VERDICT PASS (only the usual ±1 tick-timing wobble on `solarRoofs` — 226, not mine).

**Probe** (`probes/probe-wetgleam.mjs`, build-agnostic — hooks the artifact's own `createRadialGradient`/`fill`
and counts, by colour signature, the OBJECTS the frame ISSUES; no pixel diff, NO NOISE FLOOR AT ALL). Night pin
(dayT 0.92, LITAMT 1.00), 3 seeds, gleam counted as the warm-gradient fills, lamp head as the solid `255,226,152`/
`255,198,108` fills:
- **gleam DRY 0 → WET 354/398/382** — the fixed point (0 dry = block skipped = HEAD path) and it fires (one smear
  per lit lamp when wet), all 3 seeds.
- **lamp-head control (250 + positive) IDENTICAL dry vs wet (354/398/382) and > 0** — the heads don't read rain, so
  the stub moved ONLY the gleam, and their nonzero count proves the frame is a real lit night city (a dead frame
  would give gleam 0 too). WETGLEAM: PASS.
- ⚠ RIG NOTE: `ctx.fillStyle` reads back Chromium-canonicalised (spaced) — the head match had to strip whitespace
  (273); the gleam gradients are tagged at `addColorStop` time (on my own un-canonicalised string) so they were fine.

**Visual** (`probes/shot-wetgleam.mjs` — same frozen night city, shot DRY (`rainingAt→0`, ≡HEAD) and WET
(`rainingAt→1`, streets gleam) as a blind A/B zoomed 5× and **aimed by measured ink** (226/272: the only thing
differing DRY↔WET is the gleam, so the argmax of the DRY-vs-WET diff IS where it renders, HUD boxes zeroed — 200),
plus whole-city DRY + WET(flood) frames for the holistic read; tokens meaningless + non-ordinal, map **CROSSED
between seeds** (238/239/268); md5 confirmed the pairs differ). **Both blind subagents, on both seeds, on the
crossed map, correctly named the WET frame from the reflections alone** (s42 wet=`teasel` ✓ · s7 wet=`sorrel` ✓ —
a discriminating pair, 264, resolved blind on both): the wet frame's lamps stretch into warm vertical smears
running down the tarmac; the dry frame has only compact round halos. Both confirmed the smears sit **on the
roads** (not floating/on water/on roofs), **no blown-out warm blobs**, and both whole-city frames read as a
**balanced, coherent lit coastal city** — coastline/pier/moon/street grid intact, no z-order tears or floating
tiles; the WET flood frame stays coherent with the street network gleaming warmly. (One aside: "fairly subtle at
this zoom" — correct; it is a reflection, and it reads at the moderate zoom a coast is looked at, 159/266.)

**Perf.** Zero new path objects when dry (fixed point); WET adds one gradient smear per lit lamp (only where it is
actually raining, sparse in play). The night lamp block gains one `rainingAt(x,y)` call per lit road cell — but
the busker draw just below already calls it per road cell, so this roughly doubles an existing per-cell call, not
a path-object cost. Step-back (~345) prices the arc.

**Verdict: SHIPPED.** The night streets now mirror their lamps down the wet tarmac when a shower crosses — the
last un-enumerated reader of the rain mechanism, and the land analog of the waterfront reflection (329). Rain (Sky)
× night lamps × the road network, an interconnect across three domains. Exact fixed point when dry (DRY ≡ HEAD),
census byte-identical. Transport × Deepen. `probes/probe-wetgleam.mjs`, `probes/shot-wetgleam.mjs`.

## Iteration 342 — cat's-paws on the grass, and why they can't be seen (2026-07-17) [Nature × Deepen → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** Step-back #45 (@340) pointed ~342 at a measured seam (225) or a Deepen in a rotated domain (avoid
Sky/Water; Transport/People/Civic just ran ⇒ Nature/Urban rested). I ran the seam-finders first: the frozen census
tile histogram (SHOREPARK 294/294/294 and the other flat rows are audited terrain/landmarks; no dead-rule zero row —
287's `SOLARF` is now 0/0/19), the "carries no CA state" grep (only the *fixed* kelp, 282), and the tooltip table
(every tile has a LABEL+DESC; ROAD/CIVIC's missing DESC is their custom branch, not a gap). Two natural Nature/rain
Deepens were **already built** and I refuted them by reading before writing a line (the iter-34 discipline): autumn
foliage (`applySeason` ambers the deciduous canopy + `autumnFall` litter) and wet-ground darkening (the under-cloud
damp-patch blob, ~L9781, is the rainFront comment's "wet the ground"). The one genuinely-open seam, found by the 280
grep (the MECHANISM `windForce`, not a reader noun-list): **the open GRASS is the last large surface deaf to the wind
every other thing rides** — trees sway, palms/flags flap, kites fly, sails belly, smoke leans, the sea streaks into
windrows, the bunting streams (280) — while the meadow/shorepark/park grass sat as a flat fill in any weather.

**Change (built, then reverted — draw-only, no `rng()`/terrain, unreachable from `tick()`).** `grassGust(x,y,gx,gy)`
called from MEADOW/SHOREPARK/PARK/FIELD after each body fill: a **cat's-paw** — the sea's windrow on land (266). A pale
`colA('meadow',1.42,a)` ellipse, sub-hex in WIDTH (never an edge, cannot terrace — 255) and ~1.5–2 hexes LONG along the
wind, tilted off the E-W axis (or a field of streaks traces the grid), its tail trailing UPWIND over grass already
painted (draw order is depth order), gated per-hex by `hashCell` with share ∝ `windForce()`, α pulsing on a slow clock
(gusts gather and pass; too slow to strobe, 134). Day-biased (`LITAMT>0.72` → nothing, hands off to the night like the
windrow). At `windForce()==0` (dead calm, `WINDA≤0.25`) it draws NOTHING ⇒ a still frame is byte-identical to HEAD (245).

**Census.** Draw-only ⇒ tile histogram empty, `pop`/`developed`/`roads` **byte-identical (+0)**, 0 page errors, VERDICT
PASS (only the known `solarRoofs −2` tick-timing wobble, 226, not mine).

**Probe** (`probe-catspaw.mjs`, build-agnostic — hooks `ctx.ellipse` and counts the cat's-paw by its UNIQUE GEOMETRIC
signature `ellipse(0,0, len, 1.4, …)` (285: `radiusY===1.4`, a value no other ellipse forges); NO NOISE FLOOR AT ALL;
`window.grassGust=()=>{}` renders HEAD in-page, 253). 4 seeds, frozen clock: **GALE 57–66/city fires (LITAMT 0.01 =
genuinely day, 202) · CALM 0 (dead calm ≡ HEAD, exact fixed point, 245) · NIGHT 0 (day-biased, LITAMT 1.00) · HEAD
(suppressed) 0 (the ry=1.4 signature is grassGust-only — control 250 holds).** RESPONSE/DAY-BIAS/CONTROL all PASS.

**Visual — THE GATE THAT KILLED IT** (`shot-catspaw.mjs`, blind CALM/GALE A/B aimed by the cat's-paw's OWN ink (226/272),
tokens meaningless + CROSSED between seeds (238/239/268), md5-confirmed the pairs differ). **BOTH blind subagents, on
BOTH seeds, INVERTED the call** — each named the CALM (provably 0 cat's-paws) frame as the windy one, at moderate
confidence, describing "faint pale streaks" that were the meadow's own tree-shadow/texture. I looked myself (239: a
visual inversion is a cue to check the instrument, then look): the gale frame's meadow does differ — but the low-α
(~0.10) ellipse scatter **HAZES rather than MARKS** (203/215): it reads as a diffuse pale WASH over the grass that even
mildly FADES its lush green, NOT as discrete wind streaks — so the richer *un-washed* calm frame looked "more textured"
and both agents mapped that to "streaks."

**Why it can't be rescued (and why it's `polish-tile`, not a growth lap).** To read as a streak rather than a haze it
needs (a) higher contrast AND (b) a proper tapered/discrete shape (the sea windrow's cubic + `wrowHalf`, not a flat
ellipse). But a pale mark on GREEN grass bright enough to be a discrete streak reads as a **scratch/artifact** (159's
neon-tube, 214's per-edge, 215's smudge) — foam-white on teal works precisely because it is high-contrast and windrows
are a familiar sea texture; grass-wind has no foam and is subtle in reality. This is the header's own
**DEEP-BUT-INVISIBLE-AT-ZOOM** warning made manifest, and 270's rung: a defect FOUND is not a defect cleanly BUILDABLE
here — a legible tapered-streak form is a focused shape redesign, not a growth increment.

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED.** `solvista.html` byte-identical to HEAD (grassGust removed); probe + shot removed
(they reference the reverted `grassGust`). The grass-wind gap is REAL and correctly identified (280), the mechanism
fires with an exact fixed point (census + probe PASS), and it is **invisible-at-zoom as an overlay wash** — the visual
gate (two blind agents, both inverted) is the only instrument that could see this, and a passing census+probe meant
nothing for a subtle draw. ⛔ **Do not re-try grass-wind as an α-scatter overlay; if ever, it is a tapered-streak
`polish-tile` job.** Nature × Deepen. (No files added — the finding lives here, the loop's memory.)

## Iteration 343 — snow on the roofs, and why it drowns in the haze (2026-07-17) [Urban fabric × Deepen → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** Step-back #45 (@340) pointed ~343 at a measured seam (225) or a Deepen in a rested domain (avoid
Nature/Transport/Sky/Water; Urban needs a MEASURED seam). I ran the seam-finders: the frozen census tile histogram
(every flat/zero row is audited terrain/landmark — SHOREPARK 294/294/294, MARSH 45/45/45, no dead-rule zero), the
CIVHRS/CIVICDESC/TILEDESC tables (fully deepened — every civic kind keeps hours, every tile has a label+desc), and
`residentWhere` (pier/market/park/garden/plaza/beach/stadium/amphitheater/field/road all covered). The one genuinely-
open, MEASURED seam: **`SNOWLAND` is a TYPE SET that excludes every building type** (`EMPTY,MEADOW,FOREST,REDWOOD,
PARK,ROAD,ROCK,FARM,VINEYARD,ORCHARD,GARDEN,FIELD`), and the CA at ~L3193 forces `c.snow=0` on all non-members — so
the ONE surface a real snowfall settles on first, the flat cold roof, stayed bare in every winter of the artifact's
life (274: a type-keyed set is blind to members it never lists — here, ALL the buildings). The Urban analog of 341
(roads answering rain) — a surface deaf to a signal. Chosen over grass-wind (342) because a roof cap is HIGH-CONTRAST
and discrete, not a haze — or so I reasoned.

**Change (built, then reverted — draw-only, no `rng()`/terrain, unreachable from `tick()`).** `roofSnow(x,y)` reads
the EXISTING `c.snow` field over the building's own SNOWLAND ground neighbours (mean), returns 0 when no snow is lying
(`snowGlobal` gate); `snowCap(gx,gy,ax,ay,z,s)` draws the roof's own top-face hexagon (the first fill of prismS) at
roof height `z`, in the SAME alpha ramp + `colA` illuminant as the ground dusting (7154). One `const rsn=roofSnow(x,y)`
at the top of `drawBuilding` + one `snowCap(...)` after the RES/MID/COM roof prisms (TOWER skipped — crown-geometry
zoo, and towers' developed neighbours give ~0 snow anyway). Reads the field, writes nothing; `snowGlobal===0`
(~9/10 of the year) ⇒ every roofSnow returns 0, no cap drawn ⇒ a snowless frame is HEAD's exact bytes (exact fixed
point, 245/253). Respects "the coast stays clear" (321) by construction: a house ringed by bare sand catches nothing.

**Census.** Draw-only ⇒ tile histogram empty, `pop`/`developed`/`roads` **byte-identical (+0)**, 0 page errors,
VERDICT PASS (only the known ±1 `solarRoofs`/`greenRoofs`/`towerHt` tick-timing wobble, 226, not mine).

**Probe** (`probe-roofsnow.mjs`, build-agnostic — drives `tick()` to lay snow, reads the artifact's OWN `roofSnow`
over every building + hooks `snowCap` to confirm the draw fires; NO NOISE FLOOR AT ALL). 6 seeds: **WINTER 92–96%
of roofs capped · SUMMER 0 · HEAD (roofSnow undefined) 0 · draws win 772–927 / sum 0.** RESPONSE / FIXED-POINT /
BUILD-AGNOSTIC all PASS. ⚠ **But 92–96% is a near-BLANKET, not the gradient I designed:** the season probe showed the
snow field saturates to **cover=100%** the instant `winterMask()>0` (SNOWLERP=0.5 relaxes fast), and max daylight
during ANY snow moment is only **~0.28–0.38** (winter's day is SHORT, 261 — the coldest weeks are also the darkest).
So there is no bright, partial-snow shoulder to shoot: a snowy frame is ALWAYS dim and ALWAYS fully blanketed.

**Visual — THE GATE THAT KILLED IT** (`shot-roofsnow.mjs`, same-world blind A/B: caps ON vs `snowCap` no-op'd in ONE
page — 253/230, so the ONLY difference is the roof caps, an exact same-world A/B; tokens meaningless + CROSSED between
seeds, 238/239/268; brightest-winter-hour daylight). **BOTH blind subagents, on BOTH seeds, INVERTED the call** —
each named the BARE/HEAD frame as the snowy-roofed one, describing the CAPPED frame as "saturated terracotta" (it is
objectively BRIGHTER — mean luma 142.3 vs 140.7 / 140.4 vs 138.9, so the caps DO add white; the labelling was verified
correct). Both PASSED z-order + holistic on the closeup ("caps sit ON the roof tops, fixtures on top, no tears,
coherent winter town"). I looked myself (239/342): the whole-city winter frame reads as a **warm dusty HAZE over the
town, not a snow scene** (the ground snow at LITAMT~0.38 warm sunset is a uniform pale desaturating wash — iter 321's
own shipped look), and the roof caps are ABSORBED into that haze; the closeup reads as a normal warm sunset town, with
the pale caps INDISTINGUISHABLE from the artifact's already-pale roof palette (RES `cream`/`sage`/`coral`, COM
`whiteDk`, MID cream). Snow-white-on-already-pale-roofs, surrounded by snow-white ground, in dim warm winter light,
has no figure/ground — so it cannot read as *snow on the roofs*, only as a fractionally-paler city.

**Why it can't be rescued here (and why it's `polish-tile`, not a growth lap).** A brighter/whiter cap through a RAW
literal (not `colA`) would glow inconsistently over the dim-blue GROUND snow (195's coin / 214) and still not solve the
snow-on-snow low contrast. A legible form needs a distinct SHAPE — a crisp white roof-ridge line with a cast shadow, a
snow-load silhouette — which is a focused roof redesign, i.e. `polish-tile`, not a growth increment (342/270's rung: a
defect FOUND is not a defect cleanly BUILDABLE here). The fundamental wall: **winter snow reads as a warm HAZE, and a
cap on a pale roof adds no distinct read** — the header's own DEEP-BUT-INVISIBLE-AT-ZOOM warning, twice running.

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED.** `solvista.html` byte-identical to HEAD (helpers + `rsn` var + 3 caps removed);
probe + shot removed (they reference the reverted `roofSnow`/`snowCap`). The roof-snow gap is REAL and correctly
identified (274: SNOWLAND is blind to every building type), the mechanism fires with an exact fixed point + coherent
z-order (census + probe + closeup PASS), and it is **invisible-at-zoom as a low-contrast cap in a warm-haze winter** —
both blind agents INVERTED, the only instrument that could see this. ⛔ **Do not re-try roof-snow as a `colA`-white
cap; a legible form is a shaped-ridge `polish-tile` job. Winter is DIM + WARM-HAZE + already-pale-roofs = no snow
figure/ground.** Urban × Deepen. (No files added — the finding lives here, the loop's memory.)

## Iteration 344 — returns flattened: the growth phase has hit its wall (2026-07-18) [Survey → NO SHIP → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** Step-back #45 (@340) pointed ~344 at a measured seam (225), a Deepen/Polish/Interaction in a rested
domain (Civic/People, measured-seam-only), OR — explicitly — *declare returns flattened and STOP (a valid outcome)*.
Two consecutive reverts (342 grass-wind, 343 roof-snow) had just hit the same wall: a REAL deaf-surface interconnect
that is INVISIBLE-AT-ZOOM as an overlay. So the honest first job this lap was not to build — it was to **price the
remaining seam space against visibility** before spending an iteration, per the header's own DEEP-BUT-INVISIBLE-AT-ZOOM
warning and the recipe's "'one more shallow feature' is not automatically worth it."

**Survey — done BY NAME, first-hand, before writing a line (the iter-34 / 342 discipline).** The two recent SHIPS
(329 waterfront reflection, 341 wet-street gleam) are the class that works: HIGH-CONTRAST light-on-dark night
*reflections*. So I greped the artifact for every such interconnect and confirmed each already exists:
- **Sea reflections:** sun glitter (`(1-LITAMT)`-gated, day; ~L5706), the night **moonglade** (tracks the traversing
  moon, 298; ~L5298), the **waterfront reflection** (329), and the on-river current glints. Biolum surf too.
- **Road/vehicle/marine night light:** wet-street lamp gleam (341), vehicle **headlights** (the beam pools on the road,
  ~L8886; L9069 names cars/trams as already-lit), **ferry** cabin/masthead/port-starboard nav lights + water wash
  (~L9069), **freighter** lights, the **lighthouse** sweeping beam (~L6676).
- **Civic night light on hours:** `CIVHRS`→`civOpen` dims every institution's windows by its own hours (~L8044);
  `marketAmt` (285) and `matchClock` (240) gate the market/stadium; all in sync.
- **Interaction/UX:** the `ENTINFO` tooltip layer is exhaustive — every entity named, most with **live functional
  `sub`s** (ferry/launch/boat/surfer/kayak/balloon/shuttle/mono/gondola/tram/dog + the `VKIND`/`SERVDUTY` service
  vehicles), all reading the SAME predicate their draw steers by (105/249/269/278). No un-nameable entity remains.

**Census (the authoritative frozen-column seam-finder, 282/287).** Ran clean: **0 page errors**, VERDICT PASS. The
tile histogram across all three eras is healthy and MOVING (EMPTY 1354→58, MID 2→401, TOWER 0→116, PARK 76→198, …);
every FLAT/ZERO row is audited terrain or a landmark (VOID/ROCK/LIGHTHOUSE static; MARSH 14/14/14 & SHOREPARK 101/101/
101 terrain — MARSH's draw answers tide+season, 289; KELP 8/7/7, the 282-explored fixed bed). **No dead rule, no zero
row, nothing frozen-but-alive.** The entity counts show a thriving city (762 peds, 360 cars, 81 kayaks/surfers/boats,
whales/dolphins/herons/deer/balloons/copters…).

**Finding.** The additive AND the high-contrast-interconnect growth space is **EXHAUSTED**. Every seam the recipe's
finders point at (the frozen census column, the type-keyed tables, the per-cell flag lifecycles, the `tick()`/CA
passes, the animate mono-gate cliffs, the tooltip layer, the light-on-dark reflection family) is closed. The only
gaps left are the two 342/343 just proved: DEEP, correctly-identified deaf-surface interconnects (grass-wind,
roof-snow) that are **invisible-at-zoom as α-overlays** and need a shaped/tapered redesign — i.e. `polish-tile` jobs,
not growth increments (270's rung: a defect FOUND is not a defect cleanly BUILDABLE as a growth lap).

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED (a SURVEY — nothing was built).** `solvista.html` is **byte-identical to HEAD** — I
wrote no code, so there was nothing to revert; the "revert" is that the seam space was surveyed and **no vector earned
a ship**. This is a first-class outcome (recipe step 1: "declare returns flattened and STOP is valid"), and it is
recorded so 345+ does not re-run the same hunt. The loop's honest mode from here is **STEP-BACKS** (drift-watch;
~345 = #46, do it next) **+ `polish-tile`** (the shaped-ridge / tapered-streak redesigns 342/343 identified). A
genuinely new growth lap needs a NEW mechanism or domain-signal — and per 266/342/343, **price its visibility /
figure-ground BEFORE building**, because a passing census+probe means nothing for a subtle overlay: only the blind
agents can see it, and low-contrast overlays INVERT. (No files added — the finding lives here, the loop's memory.)
