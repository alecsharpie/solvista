# Solvista growth ledger

Append-only log of `grow-city` iterations. Newest at the bottom. Each iteration =
one growth vector, verified by `census.mjs` (numeric, no-regression gate) + a
screenshot pass. This file is the loop's memory: rotate vectors, don't repeat.

Census matrix: seeds `[7, 42, 1234]` × eras `[1985, 2005, 2035]`, `t=0.35`.
Metrics are summed over all 9 cells of the matrix.

## State of the city (maintained header — UPDATE EACH ITERATION)

This grid + the notes below are what step 1 (Orient) reads instead of the whole archive. Cells hold iteration numbers
(**struck = explored and reverted**, so the cell is *attempted*, not *filled* — read its entry before re-trying it);
`U1`–`U5` are user-directed passes (U1 generative monorail · U2 feedback polish · U3 determinism audit · U4 hexagon
plate + plural rivers/monorails/cable cars · U5 census stats that can fall). **Interaction/UX is a column** (since 97);
cross-cutting vectors (U2, 42, U5) stay in the bullets below, not in a cell.

- **Interaction/UX** (inventory + the `<meta charset>` repeal archived at 270; both are INVARIANTS in SKILL.md). What
  steers: when adding an entity array, `stamp()` it in its draw + add an `ENTINFO` row (same discipline as the census
  hook) — `stamp()` also draws the focus ring, so any stamped entity is ringable free. **An `ENTINFO` `sub` may be a
  FUNCTION of the entity (105)** — use it when a thing's interest is its *membership* (line/route/depot), computed live.
- ✅ **THE TRIM METHOD** (paid 279, again 280): a block is cuttable when its **LAW is in SKILL.md** and its **ARTIFACT
  FACTS compress to their imperatives**; a *superseded* warning is free to cut (280's `__setWind` retired 275's).
  There is never a block you can simply *delete* — **compress the oldest, and pay for your OWN additions in the same lap.**

  blind-PASS both seeds; core byte-flat; perf +0.06%/lap day vs iter 323 (~40 laps). **FIXED the step-back CAMERA:** its
  golden/dusk pins ignored the WEATHER FRONT (`rainFront`, a ~20yr clock on the FULL year, independent of the `year%1`
  season) — so at the fixed 2035.62 the shot seeds' sky was a random overcast, `GWARM=0`, a false grey golden hour. Now
  pins a CLEAR front per seed (walk the integer year at fixed season) + self-reports `OVC`; law in SKILL.md (the step-back's

- **⚠ SCREEN SPACE IS SPOKEN FOR (200 — archived 237; law in SKILL.md).** Probes read `getImageData()` and are **blind
  to the HUD**; `.placard` owns the top-left, `.census`/`.controls` the bottom corners. For a VISIBILITY claim about a
  screen-space draw (`ctx.setTransform(dpr,…)`: sun, moon, stars) diff **`page.screenshot()`**. The open sky is a
  shallow **band** (~0.12 of the viewport) — **do not lower the sun** (cue (s)'s trap).
- **⚠ `peds` CANNOT SERVE THE ROAD NETWORK (111, measured — read before any People vector).** A resident is leashed to
  its anchor (`PEDLEASH=2`, tuned to hold street occupancy at ~19%), so only **20–31%** of bus stops have a live ped's
  anchor within a leash: *"residents walk to / wait at / ride the X"* is structurally capped at ~a quarter of any
  road-borne host. To do it properly move the **spawn pool** (`openCells` in `syncFleet`), not the leash.
- **PERF — `perf-baseline.json` is STALE ON PURPOSE** (pinned 105; it has false-FAILed **ten** step-backs and always
  will — it cannot know today's machine load). Grade a lap by an interleaved A/B/A/B vs the previous step-back
  (`probes/perfab.mjs`, `REF=<sha>`) — **but NEVER by `perfab` ALONE: at 242 the lap timer over-read by ~2x and only

- **`?tide=` IS A URL HOOK (iter 113) — the sea is testable.** `TIDE` runs a ~2 min seeded cycle. **The default is
  seeded, not neutral — `?seed=42` loads at TIDE 0.02, dead low water.** `?tide=v` shifts the *phase* (`__setTide`).
  Use `.02/.35/.59/.98` = low / mid-ebb / **neutral** / high. **`0.59` is the pin for grading anything ELSE on a marsh**
  (below the flood-sheen cut of 0.60, and `ebb=0` ⇒ the hex body is one flat colour and nothing tidal can move).
- **`c.buzz` — the third derived field, after `c.flow` and `c.val` (iter 104, in `tick()`).** "How much is there to come
  out FOR", seen from a hex: `ATTRACT.has(c.t)?2:0` + a count of `ATTRACT` neighbours. Pure terrain derivation, no
  `rng()`. **Sparse — mean 0.54–0.59 over standable hexes, mostly 0** ⇒ a rule keyed to it is a no-op away from
  attractions. Reuse it for "somewhere worth standing"; don't hand-roll a second. **⚠ `c.buzz` is NOT `PEDDEST`** — an
  attraction field must EXCLUDE the ground you stand on (`PEDDEST`'s argmax is a lawn interior, not a shopfront kerb).
- **The CBD is published: `CBDX`/`CBDY` + `CORER`=16 (iter 98).** ⚠ **`c.val` is NOT a centrality field** — it diffuses
  `valueSrc`, whose peaks sit on **parks and water** (0.92/0.74), not the core. Anything meaning "near downtown" uses
  `hexDist(x,y,CBDX,CBDY)` — never `c.val`, never `CTRX/CTRY` (the plate's centre, which is not the city's).
- **⚠ The plate is a HEXAGON, not a square (U4):** `G` (=67) is only the bounding
  box the `cells` array lives in; the live plate is the `HEXR`=33 rings masked by
  `HEXOK`, and everything outside it is `T.VOID`. So: never loop `0..G` and assume
  a live cell — `inB()` gates it, `cellAt()` returns `null` off-plate, and a seeded
  random cell must come from **`HEXI`** (the live-cell list) or it lands in a dead
  corner. Each row's live span is `ROWMIN[y]`/`ROWMAX[y]`; the coast and its craft
  clamp to those. Per-tick development attempts are scaled by `KS`=1.46 because the
  plate carries ~46% more land than the old 48×48 square — a new per-tick placement
  loop should scale with `ks(n)` too, or it will fill proportionally slower.
- **⚠ Monorail and cable cars are PLURAL (U4):** `monos` / `gonds` are *lists* of
  independently grown lines, each closing its own loop. The old singular `monorail`,
  `monoPath`, `monoClosed`, `gond`, `gondPath` are gone — code written against them
  will silently read `undefined`.
- **Traffic flow exists — `c.flow` + `ARTFLOW` (iter 77; body archived at 241).** `trafficFlow()` drains trips down
  the road network like a drainage tree; `flow>=ARTFLOW` (64) is an **arterial** (~15% of roads). It is a **network**
  measure, unlike the *local* `busy`. **Reuse `c.flow` for anything that should follow the main roads** — don't
  hand-roll a second; `__find` answers `'arterial'`. ⚠ **But flow is a bad host for *land use* (82):** `RES→COM` on
  arterial frontage came out 85% **singletons** (by the time a street carries flow its frontage is already
  COM/MID/TOWER). Flow suits *point* decisions, not *linear* ones. **Don't re-try it.**
- **Institutions cluster: `MAJORK` / `QUARTER` / `siteQuarter()` (91; detail archived at 200/241).** `MAJORK` = the five
  monumental kinds — the shared vocabulary for "major institution", read by BOTH the civic quarter and the 2020+
  forecourt rule. `QUARTER` = the three that *seek* it; `observatory` is deliberately free to sit at the rim.
  `siteQuarter()` hugs the nearest standing major at **2-4 hexes**.
- **Open cues, banked by holistic passes (take one when its domain comes up):**
  **(g) CLOSED at 363** (`probe-seedlessdither`). All **three** genuine seedless-`hashCell` PRESENCE decisions salted
  with `seedNum^base` (night waterfront smear `0x577` · FARM hay bales `0x7A1` · harvest fruit `seedNum^(r*3+cc+50)`) ⇒
  0% vary → 62–72% vary per seed. The remaining seedless calls are **jitter/colour/offset, not presence** (the cue's own
  criterion), so imperceptible whether salted or not: river-glint phase/side, kelp sway, bale count, fruit colour. ⚠ **If

## Iteration 355 — the fresh high-contrast-local candidate is already shipped (2026-07-18) [Survey → NO SHIP → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** The last five laps confirmed the growth wall by *passive* seam-greps (351 behavioral · 353 tables · 354
comment-tells). Re-running those is redundant (354's law). So this lap ran the **generative complement**: instead of
grepping for a defect, I *generated* the strongest fresh candidates for the one thing the header still leaves open — a
**NEW high-contrast, figure/ground-LOCAL mechanism/domain-signal-reader** (the 341/280 cross-domain-signal shape, the
last thing that shipped) — and probed whether each already exists. This is the 34-beach-towels discipline run first,
on purpose: "confirm your idea doesn't already exist" *before* designing. No source touched; `solvista.html`
byte-identical to HEAD (md5 `b9dbdb8e`, = the iter-349 freeze).

**Survey — three fresh candidates, three pre-existing.** Each is exactly the profile the header demands (bright local
cue on dark ground, per-entity, reading an existing signal `LITAMT`), and the artifact already ships all three:
- **Vehicle headlights** — cars/buses/trucks read night (`LITAMT>0.35`, L8904): a beam pool on the road ahead of the
  nose, two warm headlamp points, two red taillight points. Bikes carry a bar lamp (L8817). *Done.*
- **Taxi for-hire roof lamp** — amber when vacant, dark with a fare, `LITAMT>0.3 && cabFree(v)` (L8902). *Done.*
- **Aircraft night nav lights** — the copter's tail beacon *blinks* at night (`LITAMT>0.25 && sin(time*5+ph)>0.2`,
  L10098). *Done.*
Every mover in the city already reads night with a bright local cue (add: ferry/bridge lights 179/193, lighthouse
beam, emergency beacons, street lamps, fire/strike/buoy emitters 347/348/349). The "high-contrast local night-reader"
axis is **saturated by construction** — a freshly-invented candidate lands on an existing draw, which is the strongest
confirmation the additive space is spent (stronger than a passive grep, because it is adversarial: I *tried* to find a
gap and could not).

**Census + error gate.** Tree clean; `md5(solvista.html) = b9dbdb8e8ad377d8df940e2d804a572b`, byte-identical to the
iter-349 freeze that 354 censused **VERDICT PASS, 0 errors, core `pop`/`developed`/`roads` byte-flat**. Re-running the
9-cell matrix on provably-identical bytes buys nothing (it would re-confirm 354's own reading — the grade-your-own-
instrument trap). No histogram move (no source change).

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED (a SURVEY — nothing built).** The growth vein is dry from a **sixth** angle, and this
one is generative rather than passive: the best fresh high-contrast-local candidates are already implemented. Honest
mode remains **`polish-tile`** (open cue (ay) windrow LENGTH; 342/343-class deaf-surface redesigns) — a *different
skill*. A genuine grow-city lap still needs a NEW mechanism that is neither additive-night-reader (saturated here),
whole-scene overlay (haze — 352), nor in a closed category (emitter/reflection/wind-over-water); none has survived a
probe since 341. **Recommendation: switch to `polish-tile`, or wait for source to drift before step-back #48.**
Nothing to fix.

## Iteration 356 — the behavioral and specular candidate classes are already shipped too (2026-07-18) [Survey → NO SHIP → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** 350–355 confirmed the additive wall six ways, and 355 ran the *generative* complement — but only over
**light-emitter** candidates (headlights, taxi lamp, copter beacon), the one profile the header names. This lap ran
the generative survey over the two candidate classes 355 did **not** touch, on purpose, to check the wall is not just
saturated in one profile: a **behavioral cross-domain interconnect** (nature × transport) and a **specular reflector**
(water × sky). No source touched; `md5(solvista.html) = b9dbdb8e…`, byte-identical to the iter-349 freeze.

**Survey — two fresh classes, both pre-existing.**
- **Behavioral: gulls work the boat wake / roost at dark.** The obvious un-done-looking behavior — birds clustering on
  a moving vessel — is at `drawBoat` L9124 (`if(LITAMT<0.55)`: three gulls orbit the wake behind the hull, wingbeat on
  `time`, and vanish at night). Nature×transport behavioral interconnect, LOCAL and high-contrast (white gulls on dark
  water). *Done.* (Herons roost too, L9227; shorebirds gather the damp margin by day, L6059.)
- **Specular: the moonglade.** A bright glitter path on the night sea reading the moon's live position + phase — the
  night twin of the day sun-glitter (L5706). Already shipped and traversing (iter 298 disc traverse, iter 153 one-
  predicate reader; L9685 `moonglade: the sea twinkles in a POOL THAT TRACKS THE moon`). Water×sky specular reflector,
  LOCAL. *Done.* (Reflection was already a CLOSED category per the header — 257/329/349 — this just re-confirms it from
  the *lunar* instance.)

**Census + error gate.** Tree clean; `md5 = b9dbdb8e8ad377d8df940e2d804a572b`, provably the same bytes 354 censused
VERDICT PASS / 0 errors / core byte-flat. Re-running the 9-cell matrix on identical bytes buys nothing (354's law).
No histogram move (no source change). Step-back #48 stays **deferred** — it would re-shoot #47's exact frames.

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED (a SURVEY — nothing built).** The wall now holds from a **seventh** angle (behavioral)
and an **eighth** (specular/lunar), which are the two classes 355's light-only generative survey left open — so the
generative confirmation is now complete across *all three* fresh-candidate profiles (emitter · reflector · behavior),
and every one lands on an existing draw. The additive/interconnect grow-city vein is a stable fixpoint. **Honest mode
is `polish-tile`** (open cue (ay) windrow LENGTH; birds fade α0.15 not roost) **or await a user-directed vector.**
Nothing to fix; nothing to ship.

## Iteration 357 — snow-capped evergreen crowns: correct, pretty in close-up, ~0.05% of the frame at fit (2026-07-18) [Nature x Deepen -> EXPLORED -> REVERTED]

**Vector.** 350-356 declared the additive/interconnect wall from eight angles, but every one was a generative/profile
survey - and 225's grep-the-seam law (26/26 at FINDING) is explicitly a DIFFERENT instrument from a generative survey.
So I ran a direct grep of the signal-readers instead of an 8th cold survey, and it found a genuine one the surveys
missed: the evergreen tree crowns explicitly IGNORE `c.snow`. The ground-snow draw's own comment (L7170) says the
dusting is laid "under the tree crowns above" - i.e. the crowns are painted over the snow and never read it, so the
ONLY evergreens winter ever touched were their contact shadows. A snow-laden conifer/redwood spire is the strongest
winter figure/ground there is (white on dark evergreen) and physically correct (evergreens hold snow, deciduous are
bare) - a legitimate Nature x Deepen distinct from 342's ROOF snow (roofs present edge-on/thin).

**Change (built, then reverted).** `tree()`'s conifer + the REDWOOD draw got a white wedge sharing each tier's apex,
reaching further down the spire as `c.snow` deepens, through `colA` (night snow dims blue like the ground), on the
ground-snow ramp/melt schedule (`SNOWSHOW`/`SNOWFULL`); deciduous crowns take none. Fed by a module-scope `curSnow`
set once per cell in `drawCell` (no 15-call-site param) + a `SNOWCAPON` suppressor (cf. `GFLASH`).

**Census.** Draw-only, zero `rng()`, reads only the existing `c.snow` field => core byte-flat (`developed`/`pop`/
`roads` +0; the +1 solar/tower wobbles are 226 tick-count noise). PASS.

**Probe (`probe-snowcap`, floor 0 by SNOWCAPON on/off in one page, deep winter year%1=0.12, snow ticked up).** The cap
RENDERS strongly in close-up: ~2700 CSS px / seed across 79 wood-hexes ~= 34 CSS px per wood-hex, meanDlum ~16, maxD
~187 (seed 42; seed 7 similar) - an order of magnitude above 226's unseen queue shadow (~2 px/figure). NOT the
sub-pixel-hairline family.

**Visual (2 blind agents, crossed A/B, + summer control).** Both PASSED and both, independently, confirmed the
close-up is CORRECT: snow sits ON the spires, clean z-order, no floating blobs, and summer is correctly BARE. But
both ALSO, independently, called it negligible at whole-city FIT zoom ("adds nothing perceptible at city zoom" / "you
must diff or zoom to see any change"). Measured: the ON/OFF whole-city delta is only ~500-700 bright px in a 1.26M-px
frame ~= 0.05% of the frame.

**Verdict: EXPLORED -> REVERTED.** A real, clean, seasonally-correct feature that reads beautifully up close and is
~0.05% of the frame at the zoom the diorama is actually judged - the exact 342/343/352 invisible-at-fit-zoom winter-
ornament pattern, confirmed here with a number and by both blind agents (the only "seen" instrument, 266). The
scatter of ~34px caps on ~79 tiny crowns does not cohere into a whole-city read the way the accepted ground-snow AREA
wash does. This is `polish-tile` (per-tile beauty), not grow-city (whole-city growth). Source restored to `b9dbdb8e`.
**Finding for the loop: the grep-the-seam law still FINDS (crowns unread, a genuine miss of 7 surveys) - but a found
seam is not a shippable one; the winter-ornament class is a firm NO for grow-city because it cannot clear figure/
ground at fit. Do NOT re-try snow on trees/roofs/any per-object winter cap here - the ceiling is ~0.05% of the frame.**

## Iteration 358 — the two remaining fit-visible seams are enumerated or dead-by-construction (2026-07-18) [Nature/Sky × Deepen (grep) → NO SHIP → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** 357 revived the one non-redundant passive instrument (225's grep-the-seam, a *direct* grep of the
signal-readers, distinct from a generative survey), and it still FOUND a real miss — but a winter per-object cap that
cannot clear figure/ground at fit (~0.05% of frame). So this lap ran the same instrument once more, but aimed
*specifically at the axis 357 named as the only one left open*: a seam whose fix would touch a **large / fit-visible
surface** and be **high-contrast local**, not another tiny per-object ornament. Two candidates, both settled by grep
alone. No source touched; `md5(solvista.html) = b9dbdb8e…`, byte-identical to the iter-349 freeze.

**Seam 1 — WINDA readers (enumerated, no gap).** `grep WINDA` returns a fully-enumerated reader set: the tree canopy
(L5025), palm crown (L5086), flags (L7545), clouds/drift (`windDrift`), the whole sea machinery centred on
`seaState()` — whitecaps, windrows, breaking surf (L5275/5277) — smoke lean (333), sail bellies (334), festival cloth
(338/339), balloons, the kite (`kiteGust`), and the rain shaft's lean (L9815). The gust cycle's own comments (L5261,
L10980) name its readers and 280 already closed the last two (balloon, kite). **No large surface is deaf to the wind.**

**Seam 2 — atmospheric perspective (absent, but dead by construction).** `grep -E "haze|atmospher|distance|desatur"`
confirms there is **no depth-desaturation**: far (top, small-`y`) rows are not shifted toward the sky/haze colour or
lowered in contrast relative to near rows. That is a genuine absence — the one large-surface, whole-plate signal read
the city does not implement. But it is **structurally in the 342/343/352 dead zone**: atmospheric perspective is by
definition *low-contrast and whole-frame*, and this projection is near-top-down with weak screen depth (~30 shallow
rows), so the effect would be subtle → read as HAZE → blind agents would call it negligible at fit (352's exact law:
"a whole-scene effect as a flat/near-flat wash is dead; a believable one needs a real SKY→ground GRADIENT = polish-
tile"). A found seam, not a shippable one — 357's finding, re-confirmed on the last fit-visible candidate.

**Census.** Not re-run: source is provably identical to the bytes 354 censused VERDICT PASS / 0 errors / core
byte-flat. Re-running the 9-cell matrix on identical bytes buys nothing (354's law). No histogram move.

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED (grep-only, nothing built).** The grow-city additive/interconnect vein is now a
**nine-times-measured fixpoint**, and 358 closes the *fit-visible* question the last three laps kept circling: the two
remaining candidates on large surfaces are (1) already fully read (WINDA) or (2) real-but-dead-by-construction
(atmospheric perspective, a haze). **Finding for the loop: there is no un-read large-surface signal left whose fix is
high-contrast-local — every large surface is either saturated or can only carry a subtle whole-frame wash, which is
polish-tile, not grow-city.** Honest mode is **`polish-tile`** (open cue (ay) windrow LENGTH; 342/343 deaf-surface
shaped redesigns) **or a user-directed vector / a Scale swing** (the one structural lever left, deferred per 350's
"do NOT add raw downtown density" watch). Recommend pausing the autonomous loop until source drifts or a user vector
arrives. Source restored/unchanged at `b9dbdb8e`.

## Iteration 359 — the additive NEW-ELEMENT angle closes too: an independent high-contrast-local candidate pre-exists (2026-07-18) [Sky/People × New element (grep) → NO SHIP → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** 355–358 declared the vein dry, but every one of those laps swept *interconnect / signal-reader* seams or
*large surfaces*. The one axis none of them named directly is a genuinely NEW, small-but-HIGH-CONTRAST, figure/ground-
LOCAL **additive element** — the class the header keeps warning against ("Additive space SPENT (331)") but that no
recent lap actually re-tested with a fresh, independently-generated candidate. So rather than a 5th survey I generated
one from scratch and probed it: **night festival fireworks** — bright sparks on a dark sky is the strongest
figure/ground in the whole diorama, it is local (not a whole-frame wash, so it escapes the 342/343/352 haze dead
zone), and it would sit on the existing festival machinery. This is the best-case adversary to the "additive SPENT"
claim. No source touched; `md5(solvista.html) = b9dbdb8e…`, byte-identical to the iter-349 freeze.

**Result — it pre-exists.** `grep -niE "firework|pyro|festival|bonfire"` finds it fully built: **iter 319, "a big
evening fixture ends in a fireworks display over the ground"** (L4736), *"the city has fired fireworks over the pier
every decade festival since 1980"* (L9716), gated to evening (*"you do not light fireworks at 3pm"*, L4745) on the
same `dayT` fixture clock. The single strongest high-contrast-local additive idea I could invent is already in the
artifact — which is the 355/356 "every fresh candidate PRE-EXISTING" pattern, now confirmed on the *additive-element*
axis specifically, not just the interconnect/large-surface ones.

**Census.** Not re-run: source is provably identical (`b9dbdb8e`) to the bytes 354 censused VERDICT PASS / core
byte-flat. Re-running the 9-cell matrix on identical bytes buys nothing (354's law). No histogram move.

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED (grep-only, nothing built).** The additive/interconnect vein is now measured dry from
**ten** angles, and 359 closes the last one the surveys had left implicit: NEW ELEMENTS as well as interconnect seams
and large surfaces. Even the best adversarial candidate (fireworks — high-contrast, local, on existing hosts)
pre-exists. **Finding for the loop: there is no shippable grow-city vector left at the current byte-freeze — additive,
interconnect, AND large-surface are all closed.** Honest mode is **`polish-tile`** (open cue (ay) windrow LENGTH;
342/343 deaf-surface shaped redesigns) **or a user-directed vector / a Scale swing** (deferred per 350). **Strong
recommendation: PAUSE the autonomous loop — it cannot grow the frozen source further, and every lap now spends ~40
min re-confirming a ten-times-measured fixpoint.** Source unchanged at `b9dbdb8e`.

## Iteration 360 — cue (ay) is CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION: a legible near-shore windrow is z-order-forbidden (2026-07-18) [Water & coast × Polish (structural) → NO SHIP → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** 355–359 declared the additive/interconnect/large-surface vein dry from ten angles and every lap recommended
pausing — but all ten *deferred* the one remaining OPEN cue, **(ay) windrow LENGTH**, to `polish-tile` without ever
demonstrating *why* it cannot ship here. (ay) is the strongest-looking grow-city candidate left: it lives on a LARGE
surface (the open sea, ~456k px), and 266's own law says LENGTH is the one dimension a hexagon cannot quantize, so a
longer streak is SEEN at fit — the exact property 357's per-object winter caps lacked. So rather than an 11th survey I
took (ay) seriously and designed the fix. It is **structurally unbuildable**, and proving that CLOSES the cue. No source
touched; `md5 = b9dbdb8e…`, the iter-349 freeze.

**The structural finding (from source, not pixels).** A windrow's legible length is `L=min(want, run−0.5)`, where `run`
is the open-sea fetch walked **WEST** (`cellAt(x−run−1, …)`, L5766). West is not a free choice: 266's z-order rule
(L5293) requires the tail to lie over water *already painted*, and the main loop draws `for y(N→S): for x(W→E)` (L9647),
so the only already-painted region at any hex is the **NW quadrant**; the tail therefore MUST trail NW (`tx=fx−L*CW`,
`ty=fy−rise`, L5780). But Solvista's sea is the **eastern half-plane** (`SHOREX=CTRX+11`, land `x<SHOREX`, water
`x≥shoreAt`), so westward fetch runs **toward the shore** — short near the coast, long only far offshore. ⇒ **A near-shore
hex has short western fetch BY CONSTRUCTION, so a legible row in the band the eye actually looks at is geometrically
impossible.** Both escapes fail: trailing EAST puts the tail over not-yet-drawn cells (painted out — breaks the z-order
266 was built on); reorienting rows ALONG-shore (N–S) abandons "parallel to the wind," the feature's entire physical
meaning (Langmuir rows lie parallel to wind, not to shore — it would read as a tide line, not a gust).

**The only real lever is a no-op at fit.** What remains is to cull the invisible near-shore stubs and concentrate anchors
in the deep east sea where `run` is long. But the stubs are already sub-legible (culled at `L<1.2`, faint at 1.2–2), so
removing them changes nothing a viewer sees, and the deep-sea rows that CAN be long already exist. The move trades
invisible near-shore clutter for offshore concentration — a per-surface beauty judgment (`polish-tile`), not whole-city
growth, with ~nil fit payoff. This is **357's law arriving through GEOMETRY rather than amplitude**: a FOUND seam is not
a SHIPPABLE one — (ay)'s ceiling is bounded not by tuning but by the z-order/geography interaction 266 deliberately chose.

**Census.** Not re-run: source provably identical (`b9dbdb8e`) to the bytes 354 censused VERDICT PASS / 0 errors / core
byte-flat. Re-running the 9-cell matrix on identical bytes buys nothing (354's law). No histogram move.

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED (structural, nothing built).** Cue **(ay) is CLOSED** — the last OPEN cue, *resolved*
rather than deferred: legible near-shore windrows are forbidden by the same NW-quadrant z-order constraint 266 chose, so
the residual is a fit-invisible stub cull = `polish-tile`, not grow-city. **The OPEN cue list is now EMPTY**, and
additive + interconnect + large-surface + the last polish cue are all closed/bounded. The grow-city vein is a fixpoint
from an **eleventh** angle. **Strong recommendation stands: PAUSE the autonomous loop** until source drifts (a
`polish-tile` ship) or a user-directed vector / Scale swing arrives; re-invoking it only re-confirms a measured fixpoint
at ~40 min/lap. Source unchanged at `b9dbdb8e`.

## Iteration 361 — flag-lifecycle seam (281) is CLEAN: `hstr` rides the tower, all per-cell flags audited (2026-07-18) [Urban fabric × grep → NO SHIP → EXPLORED]

**Vector.** 355–360 declared the vein dry from eleven angles and recommend pausing. Rather than a twelfth *identical*
survey (which buys nothing — 360's law), I ran ONE fresh, concrete seam-grep the recent laps had not: **281's
flag-lifecycle audit**, applied per-flag instead of as a general reminder. The header lists nine per-cell flags
(`corner`/`loft`/`solar`/`groof`/`hstr`/`bridge`/`riv`/`fete`/`snow`) and 281's tell is one grep — *does the WRITER skip
a type the VETO still counts?* Four are documented-fixed (`corner` 281, `loft` 274 via `bedOf`, `solar`+`groof` 288 —
each RIDES the COM→TOWER upgrade). `bridge`/`riv` are terrain flags on ROAD/WATER, `fete` a per-tick ROAD flag, `snow` a
diffused field — none have an upgrade-consumes-host problem. That left exactly ONE flag never audited: **`hstr`** (high
street).

**Finding (from source, not pixels).** `hstr` is CLEAN. Writer at L1131 sets it on `EMPTY/MEADOW/corr` founding-street
flanks; the develop pass (L2245) forces those to `COM`; the draw at L7979 is the **retail-podium plinth** explicitly
built to survive the tower (comment: *"the parade runs UNDER the towers… keeps its shopfront when the tower rises over
it… without this, 7 of 13 lots by 2005 would be blank tower base"*), so the flag RIDES COM→TOWER by design. Tooltip
(L10577) and find-hook (L11007) both gate `c.hstr&&DEV.has(c.t)`. Critically, `hstr` has **NO veto** — no
`countAround(…,n=>n.hstr)` anywhere — so the 281-tell (writer skips a type the veto counts) *cannot* apply. Not dead
code either: exists at scale (7/13 lots by 2005). No 281/274/288 defect.

**Census.** Not re-run: source provably identical (`b9dbdb8e`) to the bytes 354 censused PASS. No source touched.

**Verdict: NO SHIP → EXPLORED (grep-only).** The **FOURTH grep-the-seam class (flag lifecycle) is now exhausted** — every
per-cell flag is either documented-fixed or structurally exempt, and `hstr` closes the last gap. This is a *fresh*
corroboration of the fixpoint from a seam 355–360 did not touch, so it is not redundant churn — but it reaches the same
place: **the grow-city vein is a fixpoint, OPEN cue list EMPTY, source byte-frozen since 349. PAUSE stands.** Honest
growth now requires `polish-tile` (a source-drifting ship), a user-directed vector, or a Scale swing. Source unchanged at
`b9dbdb8e`.

## Iteration 362 — the frozen-census-column seam is clean: every flat/zero tile column is accounted for (2026-07-18) [Survey → NO SHIP → EXPLORED]

**Vector.** 361 exhausted the fourth grep-the-seam class (flag lifecycle) and PAUSE stands. Rather than a *thirteenth*
identical behavioral/table/comment survey, I ran the ONE concrete diagnostic the header names as **#1 — "a frozen census
column is a seam, READ IT FIRST" (282/287)** — which the last twelve laps (350–361) never touched: they grepped source
seams; none re-read the tile histogram. 287 found `SOLARF` (flat-0 for 180 laps) exactly here; 289 closed it + MARSH. No
lap has re-audited the histogram against the *current* matrix since. Pure world data — no render, no pixels, no noise floor.

**Finding (from the 9-cell histogram, not pixels).** Every flat/zero column is explained; **no 282/287-class dead rule
remains.** FROZEN all-seeds: SHOREPARK/ROCK/MARSH/LIGHTHOUSE/VOID — all terrain or one-per-city landmark (MARSH closed
289; SHOREPARK's count is fixed *by design* — the bloom CA (263) rides a per-cell flag, not the tile count; VOID is the
hexagon-plate mask). Partially frozen: VINEYARD `[0,N,N]`, ORCHARD, REDWOOD, IND — one-shot plantings / old-growth /
static industry, all expected `[0→N]` then held. Every remaining column *grows* 0→N then saturates (STADIUM `[0,2,2]`,
PLAZA/GARDEN/SOLARF/QUAD/FIELD appearing at 2005/2035) — live built structures, the opposite of a dead rule. **The
zero-row check (287's "a ZERO row is louder than a flat one") returns nothing: no tile is flat-0 across all 9 cells.**

**Census.** PASS (pageerrors 0, exit 0, no core collapse). Source byte-identical to HEAD (`git diff --stat` empty).

**Verdict: NO SHIP → EXPLORED (histogram-only).** The **fifth and cheapest seam class — the frozen census column — is
now also clean**, corroborating the fixpoint from the loop's own #1 diagnostic, a seam 350–361 skipped. This is fresh
evidence, not churn, and it reaches the same place: **OPEN cue list EMPTY, grow-city vein is a fixpoint, source frozen
since 349. PAUSE stands.** Honest growth now requires a `polish-tile` ship, a user-directed vector, or a Scale swing.

## Iteration 363 — cue (g) closed: the seedless-hashCell PRESENCE breaches are salted (2026-07-18) [Water & coast × Polish (determinism fix) → FIXED]

**Vector.** Water & coast × Polish (invariant fix). The banked cue **(g)** — "seedless `hashCell` calls paint the
IDENTICAL pattern in EVERY city" — was still live and explicitly actionable ("the night surf light-smear is the one to
fix"), and it breaches the artifact's **#1 invariant** (procedural, new city every load). This is the one shippable
grow-city vector left that is neither `polish-tile` nor closed: a *fix of a compounding breach*, which the skill lists
as a first-class outcome. Not another survey.

**Change.** Re-ran the audit (`grep -noE 'hashCell\([^;]{0,60}' | grep -v seedNum`) and classified every hit
PRESENCE vs JITTER/COLOUR. Only **three** are genuine presence decisions (a threshold test that decides whether a thing
is drawn at all), and all three used a **seedless** salt, so which cells get the ornament was pinned to world position,
identical across every seed:
- **5835** night waterfront light-smear `hashCell(x,y,77)` → `hashCell(x,y,seedNum^0x577)`
- **6525** FARM hay-bale presence `hashCell(x,y,70)` → `hashCell(x,y,seedNum^0x7A1)`
- **6562** FARM harvest-fruit presence `hashCell(x,y,r*3+cc+50)` → `hashCell(x,y,seedNum^(r*3+cc+50))`
Bases spaced per the cue's guidance. **Only presence salted, jitter/colour/offset left alone** (the cue's own criterion:
"only PRESENCE decisions are a breach worth a vector"): the remaining seedless calls — river-glint phase/side (5819/20),
kelp mat sway (5931–50), bale count `hashCell(x,y,71)` (6527), fruit colour `cc+r` (6563), etc. — are position jitter or
colour choice, imperceptible whether salted or not. Draw-only: no `rng()`, no terrain, no `c.*` writes.

**Census.** PASS (pageerrors 0, exit 0). **Every metric +0, tile histogram empty** — exactly correct for a draw-only
change the `__census()` pixel-blind hook cannot see.

**Probe (`probes/probe-seedlessdither.mjs`).** Reimplements the artifact's exact `hashCell` (L185) and evaluates each
presence-boolean over 1920 cells × the 3 census seeds. **OLD (seedless) = 0.0% vary on all three — the control that
proves the breach (same city every load); NEW (seedNum^salt) = 62.4 / 71.8 / 72.3% vary — the fix, seed-dependent by
construction.** A NEW column reading 0 would mean the salt never reached `seedNum` (dead fix); it does not. Pure
arithmetic, no browser — it can only fail on a real salting mistake.

**Visual.** Two blind subagents, night coast crop + whole-city (seeds 42, 7): both PASS. The warm waterfront sparkle
renders correctly on the water off the shore, no z-order tears / floating tiles / blown-out colour, the whole night
frame reads as a coherent balanced coastal city. Subtle, as expected for a density-preserving determinism fix.

**Verdict: FIXED.** Cue (g) is **CLOSED** — every seedless *presence* decision now varies per seed; the artifact is
procedural again on the coast and the farms. ⚠ The source has **DRIFTED** off the `b9dbdb8e`/349 freeze, so a
Step-back #48 is now warranted before the next survey. The additive/interconnect/large-surface vein remains dry; the
next honest grow-city move is still `polish-tile`, a user vector, or a Scale swing — but the one real determinism debt
banked since ~iter 281 is now paid.

## Iteration 364 — step-back #48: no drift, and the camera's golden hour was a random storm (2026-07-18) [Step-back / holistic → FIXED (instrument)]

**Vector.** The mandated step-back (source had drifted off the 349 freeze when 363 shipped). Its job: read the whole
frame at 3 lights × 2 seasons × 2 seeds for CUMULATIVE drift, plus the perf arc. It became a FIXED because the step-back's
OWN camera was lying.

**The finding (probe, before any agent).** `shot-stepback.mjs` self-reported `GWARM=0 (peaks 0)` for the golden frame on
both shot seeds — i.e. the golden hour had no golden. GWARM is not dead: on a clear-front load it peaks **0.69–0.78 at
t≈0.78** (confirmed by direct in-page sampling of `skyBot`/GWARM across `t`, now reproducible from `shot-stepback.mjs`'s
own self-report). The cause is two independent clocks. `applySeason`/`sunWarp` read only `year%1` (the SEASON); but
`rainFront()`/`overcast()` (L5177/5199) are a **~20-yr cycle on the FULL `year`** (the weather FRONT). The camera pins the
"golden dry SEASON peak" at the fixed year **2035.62** — where the front happens to be a heavy overcast for the shot seeds
(seed 42 `overcast=0.576`, seed 7 `0.603`; seed 1234 `0.273`), and `overcastSky()` (L9405) greys `skyBot` **before** GWARM
is computed at L9409 ⇒ `GWARM=0`, grey sky, a false "flat/grey golden hour" an agent would (correctly) FAIL. Worse: the
pin-DERIVATION ran with no `genWorld`, so it used the **page's random default seed** — a *third* weather front, unrelated
to the frames it drives.

**The fix (`shot-stepback.mjs`).** 259's law in the camera: pin the contaminating term. The derivation now runs
`genWorld(seed)` (so `overcast()` keys on the shot seed), and each frame **keeps its season fraction (`year%1`) but walks
the integer year to one whose front is CLEAR** (`overcast()==0`) for that seed — the artifact's own season/front
independence (L10965; `__setYear` after `__warp` moves only the calendar, never the city `__warp` built). Every frame now
**self-reports `OVC`**. Re-shot: seed 42 `dryYear=2021.62`, golden **GWARM=0.78 OVC=0 sun=UP**; the dusk pair
discriminates cleanly (`dusk-summer` GWARM 0.74 sun=UP · `dusk-winter` GWARM 0 sun=DOWN, both OVC=0). Law promoted to
SKILL.md (the step-back's third pin-trap, after 202's drift and 264's stale literals).

**Census.** PASS (pageerrors 0, exit 0). Source `solvista.html` **byte-unchanged** — the edit is probe-only, so census is
+0 by construction; it confirms no page errors and the life/transport totals are healthy (peds 762, cars 360, etc.).

**Perf (arc, not lap — `perfab.mjs REF=`).** Lap vs iter 349 (`5e06907`): **day +0.5% / night +0.2%** (noise). Arc vs iter
323 (`cfd68c2`, ~40 laps): **day +2.5% / night +1.5%** ≈ **+0.06%/lap** — well within the loop's +0.2%/lap add-only budget;
no perf drift alarm.

**Visual (2 subagents, 1 per seed, whole-frame cumulative read).** Both **PASS** on both seeds, independently: balanced,
coherent, beautiful coastal city at every light; NO z-order tears, floating tiles, blown/muddy/monochrome colour, or
compounded clutter/darkness; the golden frame reads as a genuine warm golden hour (proving the fix — pre-fix it was flat
grey); and both correctly named the dusk pair by light alone (summer sun-UP / winter sun-DOWN, longer summer day).

**Verdict: FIXED (instrument).** Step-back #48 = **NO DRIFT** — the city is coherent and beautiful across 5 lights × 2
seeds, perf healthy. The step-back camera's golden/dusk frames are now pinned to a clear front and can no longer be greyed
by a random storm. Source re-frozen at this commit; the growth vein stays dry (OPEN cue list empty) ⇒ the PAUSE
recommendation stands — next honest move is `polish-tile`, a user vector, or a Scale swing.
