# Solvista growth ledger

Append-only log of `grow-city` iterations. Newest at the bottom. Each iteration =
one growth vector, verified by `census.mjs` (numeric, no-regression gate) + a
screenshot pass. This file is the loop's memory: rotate vectors, don't repeat.

Census matrix: seeds `[7, 42, 1234]` × eras `[1985, 2005, 2035]`, `t=0.35`.
Metrics are summed over all 9 cells of the matrix.

## State of the city (maintained header — UPDATE EACH ITERATION)

This grid + the notes below are what step 1 (Orient) reads instead of the whole archive. Cells hold iteration numbers
(**struck = explored and reverted**, so the cell is *attempted*, not *filled* — read its entry before re-trying it);
`U1`–`U5` are user-directed passes (U1 generative monorail · U2 feedback polish · U3 determinism audit · U4 hexagon
plate + plural rivers/monorails/cable cars · U5 census stats that can fall). **Interaction/UX is a column** (since 97);
cross-cutting vectors (U2, 42, U5) stay in the bullets below, not in a cell.

- **Interaction/UX** (inventory + the `<meta charset>` repeal archived at 270; both are INVARIANTS in SKILL.md). What
  steers: when adding an entity array, `stamp()` it in its draw + add an `ENTINFO` row (same discipline as the census
  hook) — `stamp()` also draws the focus ring, so any stamped entity is ringable free. **An `ENTINFO` `sub` may be a
  FUNCTION of the entity (105)** — use it when a thing's interest is its *membership* (line/route/depot), computed live.
- ✅ **THE TRIM METHOD** (paid 279, again 280): a block is cuttable when its **LAW is in SKILL.md** and its **ARTIFACT
  FACTS compress to their imperatives**; a *superseded* warning is free to cut (280's `__setWind` retired 275's).
  There is never a block you can simply *delete* — **compress the oldest, and pay for your OWN additions in the same lap.**

- **⚠ SCREEN SPACE IS SPOKEN FOR (200 — archived 237; law in SKILL.md).** Probes read `getImageData()` and are **blind
  to the HUD**; `.placard` owns the top-left, `.census`/`.controls` the bottom corners. For a VISIBILITY claim about a
  screen-space draw (`ctx.setTransform(dpr,…)`: sun, moon, stars) diff **`page.screenshot()`**. The open sky is a
  shallow **band** (~0.12 of the viewport) — **do not lower the sun** (cue (s)'s trap).
- **⚠ `peds` CANNOT SERVE THE ROAD NETWORK (111, measured — read before any People vector).** A resident is leashed to
  its anchor (`PEDLEASH=2`, tuned to hold street occupancy at ~19%), so only **20–31%** of bus stops have a live ped's
  anchor within a leash: *"residents walk to / wait at / ride the X"* is structurally capped at ~a quarter of any
  road-borne host. To do it properly move the **spawn pool** (`openCells` in `syncFleet`), not the leash.
- **PERF — `perf-baseline.json` is STALE ON PURPOSE** (pinned 105; it has false-FAILed **ten** step-backs and always
  will — it cannot know today's machine load). Grade a lap by an interleaved A/B/A/B vs the previous step-back
  (`probes/perfab.mjs`, `REF=<sha>`) — **but NEVER by `perfab` ALONE: at 242 the lap timer over-read by ~2x and only
  `probe-drawbudget`'s object count and the ARC could tell** (see the ARC block). **The day column is the NOISY one

  **COST MODEL + its TWO HOLES: bodies rotated to the archive at 272; the model and its laws are in SKILL.md.** Live:

  the model** (PAID, ACCEPTED, unmeasured) ⇒ **do not shrink a gradient or cull a stroke "because 198 said count is what
  matters"**. (**Never pipe a 2+-round interleave through `tee`** — node block-buffers; run it foreground, long timeout.

- **`?tide=` IS A URL HOOK (iter 113) — the sea is testable.** `TIDE` runs a ~2 min seeded cycle. **The default is
  seeded, not neutral — `?seed=42` loads at TIDE 0.02, dead low water.** `?tide=v` shifts the *phase* (`__setTide`).
  Use `.02/.35/.59/.98` = low / mid-ebb / **neutral** / high. **`0.59` is the pin for grading anything ELSE on a marsh**
  (below the flood-sheen cut of 0.60, and `ebb=0` ⇒ the hex body is one flat colour and nothing tidal can move).
- **`c.buzz` — the third derived field, after `c.flow` and `c.val` (iter 104, in `tick()`).** "How much is there to come
  out FOR", seen from a hex: `ATTRACT.has(c.t)?2:0` + a count of `ATTRACT` neighbours. Pure terrain derivation, no
  `rng()`. **Sparse — mean 0.54–0.59 over standable hexes, mostly 0** ⇒ a rule keyed to it is a no-op away from
  attractions. Reuse it for "somewhere worth standing"; don't hand-roll a second. **⚠ `c.buzz` is NOT `PEDDEST`** — an
  attraction field must EXCLUDE the ground you stand on (`PEDDEST`'s argmax is a lawn interior, not a shopfront kerb).
- **The CBD is published: `CBDX`/`CBDY` + `CORER`=16 (iter 98).** ⚠ **`c.val` is NOT a centrality field** — it diffuses
  `valueSrc`, whose peaks sit on **parks and water** (0.92/0.74), not the core. Anything meaning "near downtown" uses
  `hexDist(x,y,CBDX,CBDY)` — never `c.val`, never `CTRX/CTRY` (the plate's centre, which is not the city's).
- **⚠ The plate is a HEXAGON, not a square (U4):** `G` (=67) is only the bounding
  box the `cells` array lives in; the live plate is the `HEXR`=33 rings masked by
  `HEXOK`, and everything outside it is `T.VOID`. So: never loop `0..G` and assume
  a live cell — `inB()` gates it, `cellAt()` returns `null` off-plate, and a seeded
  random cell must come from **`HEXI`** (the live-cell list) or it lands in a dead
  corner. Each row's live span is `ROWMIN[y]`/`ROWMAX[y]`; the coast and its craft
  clamp to those. Per-tick development attempts are scaled by `KS`=1.46 because the
  plate carries ~46% more land than the old 48×48 square — a new per-tick placement
  loop should scale with `ks(n)` too, or it will fill proportionally slower.
- **⚠ Monorail and cable cars are PLURAL (U4):** `monos` / `gonds` are *lists* of
  independently grown lines, each closing its own loop. The old singular `monorail`,
  `monoPath`, `monoClosed`, `gond`, `gondPath` are gone — code written against them
  will silently read `undefined`.
- **Traffic flow exists — `c.flow` + `ARTFLOW` (iter 77; body archived at 241).** `trafficFlow()` drains trips down
  the road network like a drainage tree; `flow>=ARTFLOW` (64) is an **arterial** (~15% of roads). It is a **network**
  measure, unlike the *local* `busy`. **Reuse `c.flow` for anything that should follow the main roads** — don't
  hand-roll a second; `__find` answers `'arterial'`. ⚠ **But flow is a bad host for *land use* (82):** `RES→COM` on
  arterial frontage came out 85% **singletons** (by the time a street carries flow its frontage is already
  COM/MID/TOWER). Flow suits *point* decisions, not *linear* ones. **Don't re-try it.**
- **Institutions cluster: `MAJORK` / `QUARTER` / `siteQuarter()` (91; detail archived at 200/241).** `MAJORK` = the five
  monumental kinds — the shared vocabulary for "major institution", read by BOTH the civic quarter and the 2020+
  forecourt rule. `QUARTER` = the three that *seek* it; `observatory` is deliberately free to sit at the rim.
  `siteQuarter()` hugs the nearest standing major at **2-4 hexes**.
- **Open cues, banked by holistic passes (take one when its domain comes up):**
  **(g) ~SIXTEEN seedless `hashCell` calls paint the IDENTICAL pattern in EVERY city** (body archived at 281).
  ⚠ **RE-RUN the audit, never a catalogue** (L-numbers drift): `grep -noE 'hashCell\([^;]{0,60}' solvista.html | grep -v
  seedNum`. **Only PRESENCE decisions are a breach worth a vector**; the **night surf light-smear** (`hashCell(x,y,77)
  <0.28`) is the one to fix. ⚠ **`darkWinR` is NOT a breach — check the callee.** When fixing a range, **space the bases**.

## Iteration 349 — the channel marks mirror their flash (2026-07-18) [Water & coast × Deepen/interconnect → SHIPPED]

**Vector.** 347/348 shipped the reusable finding — *grep shipped features for a draw that lands/emits/casts and then
stops* — and banked it as the header's NEXT VECTOR. Ran that grep across the water light sources. The **channel buoy**
(`drawBuoy`, ~L9045) flashes a red/green lamp to seaward at night (`LITAMT>0.28 && sin(time*1.4+ph*2)>0.25`, a 5px
radial glow at the topmark) — but the dark harbour water directly below it stayed dark. It is the LAST un-enumerated
water light source with no reflection (271/280 enumerate-the-category): the ferry & launch nav-lights cast "a soft wash
on the black water below" (179), the moon reflects, and 329 reflects the whole lit waterfront — only the channel marks
flashed over a dead-flat sea. Rotates the *kind* off 347/348's warm diffuse ground-pool → a COLOURED SPECULAR water
reflection (the 179/329 family). Visibility priced first (266): coloured-on-near-black is the high-contrast class that
ships (329/341/347/348).

**Change (draw-only — no `rng()`, no terrain, unreachable from `tick()`; ~14 lines).** Inside the existing flash gate,
before the lamp glow: a coloured reflection cast ON the water below the mark. A radial gradient (r=4.6) SQUASHED and
STRETCHED toward the viewer (`translate(cx,y0+6.8); scale(0.52,1.8)`) → a LONG vertical smear that survives the
downscale to fit zoom (266/341), not a flat wash that would terrace/vanish. RAW literal red/green — reflected light is
not albedo, never through `col()`/TINT (257/329, the same reason the lit windows take a raw literal). Gradient to alpha
0, never a flat arc (195). Peak α `0.58*LITAMT*sh` where `sh=0.74+0.26*sin(waveT*1.3+ph)` breathes with the swell (329),
floored high so it never blinks out. Drawn on the water below the body, so it flashes ON with the light and vanishes
with it — the reflection IS the flash's mirror. DUAL suppressors `FLASHREFL` (the new reflection) / `FLASHGLOW` (the
incumbent lamp flash) so a probe isolates each in one page, floor 0 (253/347/348's dual isolation).

**Census + error gate.** VERDICT PASS, 0 page errors. Draw-only ⇒ tile histogram empty, `pop`/`developed`/`roads`
**byte-identical (+0)** (only the known `greenRoofs/towerHt −1` tick-timing wobble, 226, not mine). Buoys **45** across
the 9-cell matrix (5/city) — the host exists at scale. Perf: the reflection draws only inside the existing flash gate
(a handful of buoys, intermittently, at night) ⇒ ~0 path objects at the fair-weather perf pins — free.

**Probe (`probes/probe-buoyreflect.mjs`).** DUAL isolation in one page (floor 0, build-agnostic): `FLASHREFL=1 vs 0` →
the REFLECTION alone (the new ink); `FLASHGLOW=1 vs 0` → the lamp's own flash (the INCUMBENT bar, 226 — no threshold
invented). Result at the night flash peak: **REFL 49–51px, peak 50–62, 17% of the incumbent flash's ink** (the same
band as 347's shipped ground-flash, 17–20%), located tightly below each flashing buoy on the water (centre y~482/501,
box below the lamp); and **0px / 0 ink by DAY** (LITAMT 0.02, the flash gate false ⇒ the free dead-regime control, 199)
on both seeds. ⚠ FIRST CUT WAS TOO FAINT (3%, 17px, peak 23) — the header's exact 266 warning that a subtle overlay
won't read; strengthened α 0.38→0.58, size, and a shimmer floor before the visual gate. BUOYREFLECT: PASS.

**Visual (`probes/shot-buoyreflect.mjs`).** Blind A/B in ONE build — reflection ON (`FLASHREFL=1`) vs OFF (`=0` = exactly
HEAD) — no build swap, no cross-build floor. Aimed by argmax of the reflection's OWN ink at the brightest flashing buoy
(226/272). Meaningless non-ordinal tokens, on/off map CROSSED between seeds (238/239/268; md5-distinct pairs confirmed).
BOTH blind agents, one per seed, **correctly named the reflection variant on the crossed map** (s42 orin=ON→"orin";
s7 vael=ON→"vael") and returned **VISUAL: PASS**: below each red/green buoy a "soft red/green vertical smear streaking
DOWN onto the dark water… tapering as it descends… sits ON the water directly below the mark, attached at the
waterline, not detached"; lamp cores saturated but not blown to near-white; no z-order tears, floating tiles or
detached glows; both whole-city frames read as a balanced, coherent night coastal city. A genuine blind identification,
not a positional guess.

**Verdict: SHIPPED (DEEPENED).** Completes the channel buoy the way 347 completed the strike and 348 the bonfire — the
mark now mirrors its own flash on the water it floats on. Third confirmation of 347's reusable finding, and it closes
the water-reflection CATEGORY (271/280): every night light on the harbour water now reflects. No new SKILL.md law
(every law used — 279/257/195/266/329/248/253/226/199/238/239/268 — is already promoted). Banked
`probes/probe-buoyreflect.mjs` + `probes/shot-buoyreflect.mjs`.

## Iteration 350 — sixty-four laps on, still no drift (2026-07-18) [47th step-back / holistic]

**Vector.** The header pointed here explicitly ("~350 = STEP-BACK #47, DO IT NEXT"). Since #46 @345, four laps have
landed: 346 (frozen-column survey, no-ship) and the three half-built-emitter completions 347/348/349 (grounded strike /
bonfire / buoy light-pools, all draw-only Deepen). A step-back is the guardrail that lets the loop run unattended — the
census catches *metric* collapse but is blind to *cumulative visual* drift and to *permanent perf* drift, so both are
measured here, not vibed. No source touched — `solvista.html` byte-identical to HEAD (5e06907, iter 349); this is a
survey, not a build.

**Census + error gate.** Clean HEAD, tree clean. `census.mjs` VERDICT PASS, 0 page errors; core `pop`/`developed`/
`roads` byte-unmoved (195508 / 6056 / 5727), only the usual chaotic ±1 wobble (`solarRoofs +1`, `greenRoofs -1`,
`towerHt -1` — 226 tick-timing, not a lap). Entity counts full and healthy (peds 762, cars 360, surfers 81, kayaks 81,
buoys 45, boats 81, etc.).

**Perf (permanent arc, PATH OBJECTS — load-immune, 198/216; `probe-drawbudget.mjs`, mean of 3 seeds, day / night):**
- iter 285 (b523698): 110335 / 138169 · iter 345 (dfec964, #46): 111672 / 140004 · **HEAD 349 (5e06907): 111732 / 139810.**
- **Long arc vs 285 (~64 laps): day +1.27% (+0.020%/lap), night +1.19% (+0.019%/lap)** — well under +0.2%/lap, and
  bang on #46's +0.017–0.021%/lap.
- **Recent arc vs 345 (4 laps, 3 shipped): day +0.05%, night −0.14%** — flat. 347/348/349's light-pools are all
  condition-gated (dry/flash/fire) and gradient-only, so they add ~nothing at the probe's pins. **No perf-fix lap needed.**

**Visual (whole-frame, 3 lights × 2 calendars × 2 seeds, `shot-stepback.mjs`, clock frozen in-page).** One blind
subagent per seed, cumulative question. Both seeds independently **PASS**:
- **City coherent & balanced** across all frames — dense inland towers → mid-rise ring → farm/park/river belt →
  beach/pier/wheel/turbines/sea, reading as one California coastal city; no wallpaper band, no muddy district, nothing
  blown-out. Both agents called the tower field varied (roof-color + height variation), not a carpet.
- **No z-order tears, floating tiles, or detached glows** — piers/wheel/turbines/buoys/boats on their hexes;
  night window-lights, street/junction/pier lamps and buoy lights all track an actual source (no orphaned glow).
- **Night coast coherent lit-city-and-water** — warm window grids, amber lamps, red/green buoys, moon + reflection on
  deep water; beach/coast strip stays dark (seed 7's small orange campfire dots on sand are 348's bonfire light-pools,
  correct) — not a flat void, and no unlit surface glowing (kelp/coast-darkening class stays closed, 282).
- **Seasonal discriminating pair resolves blind on BOTH seeds** (264): dusk-summer sun UP (warm, brighter, teal sea),
  dusk-winter — SAME instant — sun DOWN (dim, crescent moon + stars, lamp-lit). Unmistakably two seasons.
- **Watch item (STILL soft, unchanged from #45/#46):** inland tower core is dense — do NOT add raw downtown density
  (217/224/228 crown-not-picket family). Not worsening: both agents called it varied this lap too.

**Instrument nits (banked, not chased — per #45/#46).** Frames self-report `GWARM=0` and `HUD=STALE` at golden/dusk —
the known fixed-pin caption artifacts (`shot-stepback` derives the golden pin on a clear page but shoots the warped
overcast world; `phaseWord`-vs-`clockWord` mismatch). Pixels ARE warm and both agents PASS; do NOT re-chase (340
measured this out fully).

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED (a SURVEY — nothing built in the city).** `solvista.html` byte-identical. STEP-BACK #47:
**NO DRIFT.** City healthy and beautiful across 3 lights × 2 seasons on 2 seeds; day-length season alive; night ordering
/ golden-greens / sea-quilt facts hold (unre-measured — no lap since #44 touched their surfaces). Permanent draw arc
negligible (+0.02%/lap, flat recent window). Guardrail reset — the additive + high-contrast-interconnect space stays
SPENT (346), so honest mode from here is **`polish-tile`** (342/343's shaped-ridge / tapered-streak deaf-surface
redesigns) **or STEP-BACK #48** (~355). A new growth lap still needs a NEW mechanism/domain-signal, **visibility priced
FIRST** (266/342/343). Nothing to fix.

## Iteration 351 — the half-built-completion / keeps-no-hour vein is dry (2026-07-18) [Survey → NO SHIP → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** After #47 @350 the header named one remaining *growth* option (everything else being SPENT/CLOSED): "a NEW
growth lap that finds a DIFFERENT kind of half-built completion — a mover that arrives+idles, a spawn that never
completes — or a NEW mechanism/domain-signal-reader." This lap tested that option **directly**, by grepping the seam
classes the vein lives in, before building anything (the additive/interconnect/emitter space is already spent, so a
forced feature here is exactly the "one more shallow feature" the skill warns against — 344's wall). No source touched;
`solvista.html` byte-identical to HEAD (5e06907 / 630b04b).

**Survey — every seam class checked came back SOUND:**
- **Movers arrive+idle (the "a mover that arrives+idles" seam):** ferry `dwell` at the pier head · launch `dwell` at
  each end (`t>=1.3` puts about) · **copter** dwells on the pad (`t>=1.4` picks a new pad; draw clamps `p=min(1,t)` so it
  *sits* at pad B, and `sin(π·p)=0` at `p=1` so it *lands* — a true arrive-and-idle) · monorail `dw` at platforms ·
  cable car `dw` at terminals · bus `wait` at shelters. All complete.
- **Label-tells (ENTINFO / VKIND / SERVDUTY):** all cards are live functions of the entity, read off the same predicate
  the draw steers by (ferry/launch/boat/surfer/kayak/buoy/balloon/shuttle/mono/cable/tram/bus/police/ambo/fireeng). No
  frozen-string tell (113/199 class) remains.
- **Per-cell flags ride their upgrade (281/288 class):** `wear` (WEARLAND, footfall CA) · `hstr` (rides the tower up as
  a retail podium, drawn last over the base) · `civ` (plaza maturity) · `treed` (boulevard) · `bridge` · `riv` — writer,
  draw, tooltip and veto all agree on which types own each; `corner`/`solar`/`groof` already fixed (281/288).
- **Spawn-completion / sparse fliers:** `plane` is complete (contrail that spreads with age, warm-pink `GWARM` tint at
  dusk, blinking beacon, `day>0.02`-gated so it's gone at night); pelican `flock` melts into cover at night via
  `nightAmt`. 🆕 **One residual inconsistency:** the 8 loose `birds` fade to α0.15 at night (`0.5-0.35*LITAMT`) rather
  than roost — the flock's un-fixed sibling. But at α0.15 (dark-grey stroke on a dark night sky) they are **near-invisible
  at fit zoom**, so this is a `polish-tile`/Sky close-up item, NOT a growth lap (visibility priced first — 266/342/343).
- **Frozen census columns (`probe-frozencol`, 287's #1 seam tool):** only known terrain is FLAT (SHOREPARK/ROCK/MARSH
  [audited 289]/LIGHTHOUSE/VOID); SOLARF 0→0→19, MARKET 0→5→16, VINEYARD/STADIUM/GARDEN/QUAD all grow, KELP 28/33/31
  alive (282). **No new dead rule or zero row.**

**Census + error gate.** Clean HEAD, tree clean. `census.mjs` VERDICT PASS, 0 page errors; core `pop`/`developed`/
`roads` byte-unmoved (195508 / 6056 / 5727), only `solarRoofs +2` (226 tick-timing). Entity populations full and healthy
(peds 762, cars 360, surfers 81, kayaks 81, buoys 45, plane 9, copters 6, etc.).

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED (a SURVEY — nothing built).** `solvista.html` byte-identical. The half-built-completion /
keeps-no-hour growth vein is **DRY**: every mover already dwells, every card is live, every flag rides its upgrade, no
dead rule hides in a frozen column. This confirms 344's growth wall from the **behavioral** side, as 350 (#47) confirmed
it from the **visual/perf** side. Honest mode stays **`polish-tile`** or **STEP-BACK #48** (~355); a genuine growth lap
now needs a NEW mechanism/domain-signal-reader that is HIGH-CONTRAST, visibility priced FIRST. Nothing to fix.

## Iteration 352 — the whole-scene lightning flash reads as HAZE, not a flash (2026-07-18) [Sky × Deepen → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** #47 @350 / #351 both said honest mode is `polish-tile` or step-back UNLESS a lap finds a NEW
high-contrast domain-signal-reader (visibility priced first). Grepped the seams and confirmed the obvious interconnects
are ALL shipped (shopfront glow on pavement L7744 · wet-street lamp mirror 341 · waterfront/buoy/fire/strike reflections
329/349/348/347 · moonglade L9685 · sun glitter L5706). One genuinely un-built high-contrast thing survived: the
lightning system is **entirely local** — 291 lights the cloud from within, 328 drops the bolt, 347 pools light where it
grounds, but the darkened city AROUND a dusk storm stays exactly as dark as before, when a real flash floods the whole
landscape. Built it: a per-frame `FLASHAMT` (max flash across the storm's out-of-step cells, accumulated in the cloud
loop) drives one screen-space bluish-white wash over the whole viewport at the end of `render()`, alpha
`min(0.15, FLASHAMT*0.19)`. `SHEETLIFT` suppressor; reads the existing flash pulse, draw-only.

**Census.** PASS, every metric flat (draw-only, no rng/terrain/Math.random). `solarRoofs` wobble only.

**Probe (`probe-sheetlift`, temporal, LIGHTN=1 in both halves so only the wash moves, ONE page).** Clean PASS on
paper: at the strongest wet-dusk flash peak (FLASHAMT 0.837, both seeds) the lift covers **100% of the opaque scene**
at **mean d 24.7/255 (~10%), peak 36**; and it is **exactly 0px** both in dry weather AND between the flash beats
(FLASHAMT≈0 → byte-identical, the fixed point). ⚠ First cut read mean d **120 / peak 255** — the `getImageData` diff
was dominated by the transparent VOID (RGB jumps 0→236 where the wash paints it, a lift the viewer never sees behind
the CSS gradient — 200); masking to opaque scene pixels (base α==255) gave the honest 24.7.

**Visual — the gate that killed it.** 2 blind agents (crossed on/off map, 2 seeds) both PASSed the effect as
"coherent, not blown out" but **both INVERTED the filenames** — each named the *darker un-flashed* frame as the "lift"
and called the *actual flash* frame "muted / more uniformly muted," the un-flashed one "colors pop, more saturated."
Pixel measurement (239: believe the number over the read) confirmed MY map, not theirs (flash frame +19 whole-frame
mean lum). But the inversion IS the finding: **a treatment that makes blind agents prefer the control has reduced
contrast.** Looked myself: the flash-ON frame veils the whole city in a **grey-lavender HAZE** — a scrim/fog over the
plate, not a bright flash. The bolt is dramatic; the whole-scene wash only *detracts*.

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED.** `solvista.html` byte-identical to HEAD (630b04b); probe + camera deleted (they read
a `SHEETLIFT` global that no longer exists). **The finding is 260, arriving on a FLASH: a whole-frame luminance lift is
the one "event" the eye cannot read as an event.** A flat full-viewport alpha wash can only DESATURATE toward its own
colour — it cannot make a scene "pop" — and a global illuminant shift is exactly what colour constancy divides out,
read as ATMOSPHERE/haze, never as a discrete event. No alpha rescues it (higher → more washout, lower → invisible);
additive blend only trades haze for blow-out (the other warned failure). This is the low-contrast whole-frame trap
342/343 were reverted for, one rung up. ⇒ **A "whole-scene event" (a flash, a dawn break, floodlight-the-city) built
as a FLAT OVERLAY is dead on arrival, and a passing luminance/coverage probe proves NOTHING about it — only the blind
agents/eyes can judge a desaturating wash (266).** A believable whole-scene flash would have to be brightest at the
SKY/source and fall off toward the ground (a directional gradient, not a flat veil), which is a `polish-tile`-scale
redesign, not a growth lap. The lightning system stays local, and it is complete as it stands.

## Iteration 353 — the type-keyed TABLE seam is sound (2026-07-18) [Survey → NO SHIP → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** Three of the last four laps (344 declared the growth wall · 350 #47 confirmed it from the visual/perf side ·
351 surveyed every *behavioral* seam dry · 352 reverted the last high-contrast interconnect). Re-running 351's behavioral
survey would be redundant, so this lap tested a **different** seam class that neither 351 nor 352 covered and that the
loop's biggest recent finds came from: the **type-keyed TABLES** (285's law — a table keyed on `c.kind`/`c.t` is
structurally blind to a member that lives at a different level of the type hierarchy; 288's TOWER-can't-wear-tech is the
same shape). No source touched; `solvista.html` byte-identical to HEAD (630b04b).

**Survey — every table checked came back SOUND** (audited all 32 `T.*` tile types against each table's key set):
- **TILELABEL** covers 31/32 — only `VOID` missing, correct (the void is not a tile you hover).
- **TILEDESC** covers 29/32 — missing `ROAD`, `CIVIC`, `VOID`, and all three are **handled bespoke in `describeTile`**,
  not by the table: `T.CIVIC` → `CIVICLABEL`/`CIVICDESC[c.kind]` (per-kind, the correct level); `T.ROAD` → a rich branch
  naming fete/bridge/boulevard/arterial/busy/quiet off its own flags; `VOID` unreachable. No gap.
- **POPW** covers only the 7 pop-bearing types (RES/MID/COM/TOWER/CIVIC/IND/MARKET) — intentional; a park has no
  residents, and a loft's pop is keyed per-cell not per-row (274).
- **BEDT** covers only the 4 windowed building types — intentional, and the loft's night curfew was already moved to the
  per-cell `bedOf(c)` (274), so `T.IND` correctly stays OUT of the table (a `BEDT[T.IND]` row would bed the working
  shed's night-shift clerestory, 173).

Every missing member is a deliberate omission with a correct alternative path — none is the 285/288-class silent
type-hierarchy blindness. This is a fourth independent confirmation of the growth wall (344 declared · 350 visual/perf ·
351 behavioral · **353 structural/table**).

**Census + error gate.** Clean HEAD, tree clean. `census.mjs` VERDICT PASS, 0 page errors; core `pop`/`developed`/
`roads` byte-unmoved (195508 / 6056 / 5727), only `solarRoofs +1` / `greenRoofs +1` / `towerHt +1` (226 tick-timing).
Entity populations full and healthy (peds 762, cars 360, surfers 81, kayaks 81, buoys 45, plane 9, copters 6, etc.).

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED (a SURVEY — nothing built).** `solvista.html` byte-identical. The type-keyed TABLE seam
is **SOUND** — the growth wall now stands confirmed from the behavioral (351), interconnect (352) *and* structural (353)
angles. Honest mode stays **`polish-tile`** (the shaped-gradient deaf-surface redesigns: birds-roost close-up, 342/343's
snow-ridge/cat's-paws, 352's flash-as-sky→ground-gradient) or **STEP-BACK #48** (~355). A genuine growth lap still needs
a NEW mechanism/domain-signal-reader that is HIGH-CONTRAST and figure/ground LOCAL, and none has survived a probe since
341. Nothing to fix.

## Iteration 354 — the comment-tell seam is clean, and the source has been byte-frozen for five laps (2026-07-18) [Survey → NO SHIP → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** Five of the last five laps found nothing to ship: 344 declared the growth wall, 350 (#47) confirmed it
visual/perf, 351 surveyed the behavioral seams (movers/cards/flags/frozen-columns) dry, 352 built and reverted the
last high-contrast whole-scene interconnect (the lightning flash → haze), 353 audited the type-keyed TABLES sound.
Re-running any of those would be redundant, so this lap tested a **different** seam class none of them covered and
that the loop's biggest historic finds came from: the **comment-tell family** — 199 (a name/comment asserting a
behavior its value can't have) · 282 (a comment asserting an *absence* the code contradicts) · 278 (a "computed
live" whose only caller is an event) · 280 (a comment enumerating its category as a changelog, so a sibling is
missing). No source touched; `solvista.html` byte-identical to HEAD (630b04b / 5e06907).

**Survey — the comment-tell seam came back CLEAN.** Grepped every `/* */` comment carrying `never|always|once|static|
constant|frozen|fixed|no .*state|does not|carries no`. Every hit is a **healthy justification of correct behavior**,
not a defect-tell — the *inverse* of the 282 shape (an assertion of an absence that turns out true because the rule
is dead):
- **"X is right *because* it never Y":** `Math.random so [dolphins] never perturb the [stream]` (L1352) · `outside the
  plate: never drawn, never grows` (L992) · `the band can never spill past the waterline` (L6025) · `three salt RANGES,
  spaced so 0x..+j can never collide` (L6733) · `never atop track already down` (L3271). All are correctness proofs.
- **Tooltip-reads-the-SAME-predicate-the-draw-does** (the FIXED 113/199 shape, not the tell): `so it can never call a
  wrong hour` (L4670/4758) · `the MARKET… never got one (iter 285)` now DOES (L4802/4846) · `so the two can never [drift]`
  (L2094). These are the label-tell already *closed*.
- **Deliberate un-readers, correctly commented:** `a palm does not feel the drought` / `the palm's band is UNSEASONED
  — a palm does not migrate` (L5091/6177) — the 247 palm-vs-umbrella fix, working as designed.
- **The one genuine open item is already banked and out of scope:** `the foam gets a SHAPE, because it could never get
  a SIZE` (L5277) = open cue **(ay)** windrow LENGTH — a `polish-tile` job, not a growth lap.
No absence-asserting-a-LIVE-rule (282), no changelog-as-taxonomy with a missing sibling (280), no frozen "computed
live" (278). This confirms 344's growth wall from a **fifth** independent angle.

**⚠ The load-bearing new fact: SOURCE IS BYTE-FROZEN SINCE ITER 349.** `md5(solvista.html)` = `b9dbdb8e8ad377d8df940e2d804a572b`
for HEAD **≡ iter 349 (5e06907) ≡ iter 350 (#47, d6b7805)** — 350/351/352/353/354 shipped no bytes. Consequences:
- Path objects unchanged by construction (measured `probe-drawbudget` night total ~139,837 = iter 349's 139,810). The
  permanent perf arc is *identical* to what #47 measured; there is nothing new on the perf axis to price.
- **A STEP-BACK #48 now would re-shoot #47's byte-identical frames and re-spawn blind agents to re-confirm a
  byte-identical PASS** — the redundant-lap / grade-your-own-instrument trap. **A step-back's whole job is to catch
  DRIFT since the last one, and there has been ZERO source drift.** So #48 is deferred until an actual ship moves the
  bytes; re-running it on frozen source buys nothing. (The header's "#48 @~355" is superseded by this.)

**Census + error gate.** Clean HEAD, tree clean. `census.mjs` VERDICT PASS, 0 page errors; core `pop`/`developed`/
`roads` byte-flat (195508 / 6056 / 5727); entity populations full and healthy (peds 762, cars 360, surfers 81,
kayaks 81, buoys 45, plane 9, copters 6, etc.). No histogram move (no source change).

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED (a SURVEY — nothing built).** `solvista.html` byte-identical. The comment-tell seam is
**CLEAN** — the growth vein is now dry from FIVE angles (declared 344 · visual/perf 350 · behavioral 351 · table 353 ·
comment-tell 354). Honest mode is **`polish-tile`** (open cue (ay) windrow LENGTH; 342/343-class deaf-surface
redesigns) **or wait for source to drift before the next step-back**. A genuine growth lap still needs a NEW
mechanism/domain-signal-reader that is HIGH-CONTRAST and figure/ground LOCAL — none has survived a probe since 341.
Nothing to fix.

## Iteration 355 — the fresh high-contrast-local candidate is already shipped (2026-07-18) [Survey → NO SHIP → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** The last five laps confirmed the growth wall by *passive* seam-greps (351 behavioral · 353 tables · 354
comment-tells). Re-running those is redundant (354's law). So this lap ran the **generative complement**: instead of
grepping for a defect, I *generated* the strongest fresh candidates for the one thing the header still leaves open — a
**NEW high-contrast, figure/ground-LOCAL mechanism/domain-signal-reader** (the 341/280 cross-domain-signal shape, the
last thing that shipped) — and probed whether each already exists. This is the 34-beach-towels discipline run first,
on purpose: "confirm your idea doesn't already exist" *before* designing. No source touched; `solvista.html`
byte-identical to HEAD (md5 `b9dbdb8e`, = the iter-349 freeze).

**Survey — three fresh candidates, three pre-existing.** Each is exactly the profile the header demands (bright local
cue on dark ground, per-entity, reading an existing signal `LITAMT`), and the artifact already ships all three:
- **Vehicle headlights** — cars/buses/trucks read night (`LITAMT>0.35`, L8904): a beam pool on the road ahead of the
  nose, two warm headlamp points, two red taillight points. Bikes carry a bar lamp (L8817). *Done.*
- **Taxi for-hire roof lamp** — amber when vacant, dark with a fare, `LITAMT>0.3 && cabFree(v)` (L8902). *Done.*
- **Aircraft night nav lights** — the copter's tail beacon *blinks* at night (`LITAMT>0.25 && sin(time*5+ph)>0.2`,
  L10098). *Done.*
Every mover in the city already reads night with a bright local cue (add: ferry/bridge lights 179/193, lighthouse
beam, emergency beacons, street lamps, fire/strike/buoy emitters 347/348/349). The "high-contrast local night-reader"
axis is **saturated by construction** — a freshly-invented candidate lands on an existing draw, which is the strongest
confirmation the additive space is spent (stronger than a passive grep, because it is adversarial: I *tried* to find a
gap and could not).

**Census + error gate.** Tree clean; `md5(solvista.html) = b9dbdb8e8ad377d8df940e2d804a572b`, byte-identical to the
iter-349 freeze that 354 censused **VERDICT PASS, 0 errors, core `pop`/`developed`/`roads` byte-flat**. Re-running the
9-cell matrix on provably-identical bytes buys nothing (it would re-confirm 354's own reading — the grade-your-own-
instrument trap). No histogram move (no source change).

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED (a SURVEY — nothing built).** The growth vein is dry from a **sixth** angle, and this
one is generative rather than passive: the best fresh high-contrast-local candidates are already implemented. Honest
mode remains **`polish-tile`** (open cue (ay) windrow LENGTH; 342/343-class deaf-surface redesigns) — a *different
skill*. A genuine grow-city lap still needs a NEW mechanism that is neither additive-night-reader (saturated here),
whole-scene overlay (haze — 352), nor in a closed category (emitter/reflection/wind-over-water); none has survived a
probe since 341. **Recommendation: switch to `polish-tile`, or wait for source to drift before step-back #48.**
Nothing to fix.

## Iteration 356 — the behavioral and specular candidate classes are already shipped too (2026-07-18) [Survey → NO SHIP → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** 350–355 confirmed the additive wall six ways, and 355 ran the *generative* complement — but only over
**light-emitter** candidates (headlights, taxi lamp, copter beacon), the one profile the header names. This lap ran
the generative survey over the two candidate classes 355 did **not** touch, on purpose, to check the wall is not just
saturated in one profile: a **behavioral cross-domain interconnect** (nature × transport) and a **specular reflector**
(water × sky). No source touched; `md5(solvista.html) = b9dbdb8e…`, byte-identical to the iter-349 freeze.

**Survey — two fresh classes, both pre-existing.**
- **Behavioral: gulls work the boat wake / roost at dark.** The obvious un-done-looking behavior — birds clustering on
  a moving vessel — is at `drawBoat` L9124 (`if(LITAMT<0.55)`: three gulls orbit the wake behind the hull, wingbeat on
  `time`, and vanish at night). Nature×transport behavioral interconnect, LOCAL and high-contrast (white gulls on dark
  water). *Done.* (Herons roost too, L9227; shorebirds gather the damp margin by day, L6059.)
- **Specular: the moonglade.** A bright glitter path on the night sea reading the moon's live position + phase — the
  night twin of the day sun-glitter (L5706). Already shipped and traversing (iter 298 disc traverse, iter 153 one-
  predicate reader; L9685 `moonglade: the sea twinkles in a POOL THAT TRACKS THE moon`). Water×sky specular reflector,
  LOCAL. *Done.* (Reflection was already a CLOSED category per the header — 257/329/349 — this just re-confirms it from
  the *lunar* instance.)

**Census + error gate.** Tree clean; `md5 = b9dbdb8e8ad377d8df940e2d804a572b`, provably the same bytes 354 censused
VERDICT PASS / 0 errors / core byte-flat. Re-running the 9-cell matrix on identical bytes buys nothing (354's law).
No histogram move (no source change). Step-back #48 stays **deferred** — it would re-shoot #47's exact frames.

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED (a SURVEY — nothing built).** The wall now holds from a **seventh** angle (behavioral)
and an **eighth** (specular/lunar), which are the two classes 355's light-only generative survey left open — so the
generative confirmation is now complete across *all three* fresh-candidate profiles (emitter · reflector · behavior),
and every one lands on an existing draw. The additive/interconnect grow-city vein is a stable fixpoint. **Honest mode
is `polish-tile`** (open cue (ay) windrow LENGTH; birds fade α0.15 not roost) **or await a user-directed vector.**
Nothing to fix; nothing to ship.

## Iteration 357 — snow-capped evergreen crowns: correct, pretty in close-up, ~0.05% of the frame at fit (2026-07-18) [Nature x Deepen -> EXPLORED -> REVERTED]

**Vector.** 350-356 declared the additive/interconnect wall from eight angles, but every one was a generative/profile
survey - and 225's grep-the-seam law (26/26 at FINDING) is explicitly a DIFFERENT instrument from a generative survey.
So I ran a direct grep of the signal-readers instead of an 8th cold survey, and it found a genuine one the surveys
missed: the evergreen tree crowns explicitly IGNORE `c.snow`. The ground-snow draw's own comment (L7170) says the
dusting is laid "under the tree crowns above" - i.e. the crowns are painted over the snow and never read it, so the
ONLY evergreens winter ever touched were their contact shadows. A snow-laden conifer/redwood spire is the strongest
winter figure/ground there is (white on dark evergreen) and physically correct (evergreens hold snow, deciduous are
bare) - a legitimate Nature x Deepen distinct from 342's ROOF snow (roofs present edge-on/thin).

**Change (built, then reverted).** `tree()`'s conifer + the REDWOOD draw got a white wedge sharing each tier's apex,
reaching further down the spire as `c.snow` deepens, through `colA` (night snow dims blue like the ground), on the
ground-snow ramp/melt schedule (`SNOWSHOW`/`SNOWFULL`); deciduous crowns take none. Fed by a module-scope `curSnow`
set once per cell in `drawCell` (no 15-call-site param) + a `SNOWCAPON` suppressor (cf. `GFLASH`).

**Census.** Draw-only, zero `rng()`, reads only the existing `c.snow` field => core byte-flat (`developed`/`pop`/
`roads` +0; the +1 solar/tower wobbles are 226 tick-count noise). PASS.

**Probe (`probe-snowcap`, floor 0 by SNOWCAPON on/off in one page, deep winter year%1=0.12, snow ticked up).** The cap
RENDERS strongly in close-up: ~2700 CSS px / seed across 79 wood-hexes ~= 34 CSS px per wood-hex, meanDlum ~16, maxD
~187 (seed 42; seed 7 similar) - an order of magnitude above 226's unseen queue shadow (~2 px/figure). NOT the
sub-pixel-hairline family.

**Visual (2 blind agents, crossed A/B, + summer control).** Both PASSED and both, independently, confirmed the
close-up is CORRECT: snow sits ON the spires, clean z-order, no floating blobs, and summer is correctly BARE. But
both ALSO, independently, called it negligible at whole-city FIT zoom ("adds nothing perceptible at city zoom" / "you
must diff or zoom to see any change"). Measured: the ON/OFF whole-city delta is only ~500-700 bright px in a 1.26M-px
frame ~= 0.05% of the frame.

**Verdict: EXPLORED -> REVERTED.** A real, clean, seasonally-correct feature that reads beautifully up close and is
~0.05% of the frame at the zoom the diorama is actually judged - the exact 342/343/352 invisible-at-fit-zoom winter-
ornament pattern, confirmed here with a number and by both blind agents (the only "seen" instrument, 266). The
scatter of ~34px caps on ~79 tiny crowns does not cohere into a whole-city read the way the accepted ground-snow AREA
wash does. This is `polish-tile` (per-tile beauty), not grow-city (whole-city growth). Source restored to `b9dbdb8e`.
**Finding for the loop: the grep-the-seam law still FINDS (crowns unread, a genuine miss of 7 surveys) - but a found
seam is not a shippable one; the winter-ornament class is a firm NO for grow-city because it cannot clear figure/
ground at fit. Do NOT re-try snow on trees/roofs/any per-object winter cap here - the ceiling is ~0.05% of the frame.**

## Iteration 358 — the two remaining fit-visible seams are enumerated or dead-by-construction (2026-07-18) [Nature/Sky × Deepen (grep) → NO SHIP → EXPLORED → REVERTED]

**Vector.** 357 revived the one non-redundant passive instrument (225's grep-the-seam, a *direct* grep of the
signal-readers, distinct from a generative survey), and it still FOUND a real miss — but a winter per-object cap that
cannot clear figure/ground at fit (~0.05% of frame). So this lap ran the same instrument once more, but aimed
*specifically at the axis 357 named as the only one left open*: a seam whose fix would touch a **large / fit-visible
surface** and be **high-contrast local**, not another tiny per-object ornament. Two candidates, both settled by grep
alone. No source touched; `md5(solvista.html) = b9dbdb8e…`, byte-identical to the iter-349 freeze.

**Seam 1 — WINDA readers (enumerated, no gap).** `grep WINDA` returns a fully-enumerated reader set: the tree canopy
(L5025), palm crown (L5086), flags (L7545), clouds/drift (`windDrift`), the whole sea machinery centred on
`seaState()` — whitecaps, windrows, breaking surf (L5275/5277) — smoke lean (333), sail bellies (334), festival cloth
(338/339), balloons, the kite (`kiteGust`), and the rain shaft's lean (L9815). The gust cycle's own comments (L5261,
L10980) name its readers and 280 already closed the last two (balloon, kite). **No large surface is deaf to the wind.**

**Seam 2 — atmospheric perspective (absent, but dead by construction).** `grep -E "haze|atmospher|distance|desatur"`
confirms there is **no depth-desaturation**: far (top, small-`y`) rows are not shifted toward the sky/haze colour or
lowered in contrast relative to near rows. That is a genuine absence — the one large-surface, whole-plate signal read
the city does not implement. But it is **structurally in the 342/343/352 dead zone**: atmospheric perspective is by
definition *low-contrast and whole-frame*, and this projection is near-top-down with weak screen depth (~30 shallow
rows), so the effect would be subtle → read as HAZE → blind agents would call it negligible at fit (352's exact law:
"a whole-scene effect as a flat/near-flat wash is dead; a believable one needs a real SKY→ground GRADIENT = polish-
tile"). A found seam, not a shippable one — 357's finding, re-confirmed on the last fit-visible candidate.

**Census.** Not re-run: source is provably identical to the bytes 354 censused VERDICT PASS / 0 errors / core
byte-flat. Re-running the 9-cell matrix on identical bytes buys nothing (354's law). No histogram move.

**Verdict: EXPLORED → REVERTED (grep-only, nothing built).** The grow-city additive/interconnect vein is now a
**nine-times-measured fixpoint**, and 358 closes the *fit-visible* question the last three laps kept circling: the two
remaining candidates on large surfaces are (1) already fully read (WINDA) or (2) real-but-dead-by-construction
(atmospheric perspective, a haze). **Finding for the loop: there is no un-read large-surface signal left whose fix is
high-contrast-local — every large surface is either saturated or can only carry a subtle whole-frame wash, which is
polish-tile, not grow-city.** Honest mode is **`polish-tile`** (open cue (ay) windrow LENGTH; 342/343 deaf-surface
shaped redesigns) **or a user-directed vector / a Scale swing** (the one structural lever left, deferred per 350's
"do NOT add raw downtown density" watch). Recommend pausing the autonomous loop until source drifts or a user vector
arrives. Source restored/unchanged at `b9dbdb8e`.
