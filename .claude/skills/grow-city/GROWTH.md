# Solvista growth ledger

Append-only log of `grow-city` iterations. Newest at the bottom. Each iteration =
one growth vector, verified by `census.mjs` (numeric, no-regression gate) + a
screenshot pass. This file is the loop's memory: rotate vectors, don't repeat.

Census matrix: seeds `[7, 42, 1234]` × eras `[1985, 2005, 2035]`, `t=0.35`.
Metrics are summed over all 9 cells of the matrix.

## State of the city (maintained header — UPDATE EACH ITERATION)

This grid + the notes below are what step 1 (Orient) reads instead of the whole
archive. Cells hold iteration numbers (**struck = explored and reverted**, so the
cell is *attempted*, not *filled* — read its entry before re-trying it); `U1`–`U5` are user-directed passes
(U1 generative monorail · U2 feedback polish: smooth water motion / hover
tooltip / kelp re-gate · U3 determinism audit · U4 hexagon plate + plural
rivers/monorails/cable cars · U5 census stats that can fall).

**Interaction/UX is now a column** (added iter 97). It was a documented *kind* that lived only in
the bullet below, so a domain touched by an Interaction vector still looked untouched to step 1's
rotation scan. Cells hold only vectors the ledger explicitly attributes to a domain; cross-cutting
ones (U2, 42, U5) stay in the bullet.

- **Interaction/UX kind:** tile tooltip (U2, user-directed) + **entity
  tooltips (iter 42)** + **Est./Built years in tooltips (iter 52, Civic-led)**
  + **hover focus ring (iter 71, People-led)** + **census stats that can fall
  (U5: tallest / density / solar share / transit reach / walkable)**
  + **the coast names itself (iter 97, Water-led: pier/stall/ferris wheel,
  esplanade, lifeguard tower, dune `Sand`+`Marram grass`, live `Tide`)**
  + **the transit lines name themselves (iter 105, Transport-led: hovering a monorail train or
  cable-car cabin names its LINE — "Line 3 of 3 — a 183-span loop with 30 stations" — and traces the
  whole route across the city, pipped at its stops)**
  + **the woods name their own stand (iter 117, Nature-led: `Stand — N hexes` by live flood fill,
  `Canopy Closed/Thickening/Open edge` read from the draw's own `k`, `Undisturbed ~N yr`,
  `Old growth since`, `Deep woods`, `Mushrooms up`, `Burning`, and a live
  `Wildflowers In bloom/Gone over/Not in flower`)**
  + **the institutions name themselves (iter 122, Civic-led: `CIVICDESC` gives all 12 kinds their own
  sentence, drawn from each one's siting rule; `Civic quarter — N institutions` by `siteQuarter`'s own
  `MAJORK`/`QFAR`; `Fronts a paved forecourt` / `Keeps its own grounds behind`, and the squares answer
  back with `Forecourt of — Town hall` / `Grounds of — Museum`; `One of — 4 schools`)**.
  When adding an entity array: `stamp()` it in its draw + add an `ENTINFO` row
  (same discipline as the census hook). `stamp()` now also draws the focus ring,
  so any stamped entity is ringable for free — **and since iter 133 a hovered TILE is ringed too (cue l closed)**.
  **An `ENTINFO` `sub` may be a
  FUNCTION of the entity (iter 105)** — use it when a thing's interest is its
  *membership* (which line / route / depot), computed live, not a stored string.
- **ROTATION.** Last vector per domain:
  Sky **153** · Urban **151** · People **154** · Nature **156** · Transport **155** · Civic **158** · Water **159**.
  **Stalest is now Urban (151)**, then Sky (153) — check the last entry of the stalest domain for a banked
  finding before reading its row. (**137 took People × Polish**: gave the walking figures — peds/dogs/joggers,
  the only movers with no `shadS()` shadow while every vehicle has one — the house-style contact shadow at the
  feet; draw-only, `probe-figshadow` gates it. People's figure/crowd draws are richly polished now; only the
  *static* standing crowds still cast no shadow. **⚠ The live ped/dog system is non-reproducible across page
  loads — probe figure DRAW changes by controlled placement, not a build-vs-build diff (137's findings).**) (**Sky's moon is FIXED (135) and now NAMED (144).** 135 re-clocked the moon's phase onto the slow `dayT`
  (~110 s/cycle) not the fast `year`, killing the ~2 Hz strobe; 144 shipped the moon-only HUD card 135 had banked — the
  census strip's 2nd stat reads `NN% / <phase>` from `moonWord()` off that same slow clock, a fifth reader of the one field
  (`probe-moonhud`: 1 transition/6 s at 8×, 8/8 phases, night agent confirmed card=disc). **STILL banked for Sky: the SEASON
  word** — it reads the fast `year` and would strobe ~0.7 Hz (134), so it needs a slow clock (or quantize/hold) FIRST; don't
  add `seasonWord(year)` to the HUD nor re-ship 134's REVERTED almanac assuming 135/144 unblocked it. Sky's additive/CA cells are still traps, see below.) (**132 took Water × Polish** — the kelp beds got a floating olive canopy so a bed reads as a living
  forest, not a flat dark hole, while staying the darkest thing inshore; `probe-kelp` gates it.)
  **Water's STILL-banked cue (123): the pier/lifeguard are still `rng()`-salted; site them on a depth by respending
  their draws (123's stream-neutral trick) — but that REPEATS 123's site-on-depth mechanism, so vary it.** (**129 cashed the tell a 7th time for Nature**:
  the orchard drew a blossom/fruit calendar since iter 57 but its tooltip was mute; it now names the
  season via a shared `orchardPhase()`. **129's banked Nature Deepen is CASHED (iter 139)**: VINEYARD's
  grapes/canes now read `year` via a shared `vinePhase()` (bare in winter → purple at harvest), the last frozen
  agriculture tile. **Its tooltip is now CASHED (iter 148)** — a `Vines` season row reads the same `vinePhase()`
  (`Bare canes`/`In leaf`/`Green fruit`/`Ripe for harvest`), like 129's orchard `Grove` row. **The
  asserts-less-than-the-code-knows tell is now SPENT for agriculture** (orchard 129 + vineyard 148); GARDEN's draw
  does not read `year` (needs a Deepen first, per 129), so the next Nature × Interaction/UX is a *new* seam.) (**127 took People × New element** aimed not at its spent
  *entity* list but at its biggest untouched *surface* — PARK's 878 hexes now show day-only picnics. The lesson:
  "additive inventory spent" is a claim about a domain's entities, not its surfaces.) (**126 took Sky × Deepen** — the moon now keeps a calendar
  and the moonglade dims with its phase — which is the documented way past Sky's additive saturation: a Deepen
  that adds no element. Sky is no longer stale, and its empty `New CA rule` cell is still a trap, not an invitation.)
  **124 closed the ghost-`c.solar` cue (detail in archive) — the LAST banked cue that moved a census number;
  from here the census is vacuous for most vectors, so reach for a probe.**
  **123 cashed the cue banked for Water, exactly as 122 cashed Civic's, 121 cue (h), and 119 cue from 111:
  four laps running where *the header told the iteration what to do*.** That is the loop working. **But 123 also
  found the banked cue's own description of the code was WRONG** (it said `hashCell`; the turbines were `rng()`),
  and the implementation the cue prescribed would have reshuffled the seeded stream. **A cue is a pointer, not a
  spec — re-grep the seam before designing to it.**
  **120 broke rotation deliberately and
  logged why**: it was the mandated holistic step-back, the step-back found a real defect, and the skill's own
  rule ("if something compounded badly, spend the next iteration FIXING it") outranks rotation. A step-back
  that finds a defect and then ships an unrelated vector has wasted the step-back. **Every domain except Sky now
  has an Interaction/UX vector** (133 filled Urban's via cue (l); 118 had closed cue (j)).
  **119 took People × Deepen, its FULLEST cell, and was right to** — because 111 had already *measured*
  and banked the vector there (move the ped spawn pool). **A banked, measured finding outranks both
  kind-rotation and cell-emptiness**; the grid says what is *untried*, not what is *most wanted*. Check
  the last entry of the stalest domain for a banked finding before reading its row.
  **⚠ 118 declined the header's own "coldest kind" steer, and was right to.** The header said *New element*;
  118 first grepped the Urban draw and found its additive moves **spent** (cranes, helipads, masts, skybridges,
  lofts, solar/green roofs, terraces, neon, podia — full inventory in 118's last finding). Saturation beats
  kind-rotation: when a domain's additive cell is exhausted, the kind changes, not the domain. Read the
  inventory before proposing an Urban **New element**.
  **Sky's twenty-lap staleness is spent** — 115 took it *without* adding anything, which is the
  documented way past its additive saturation (surveyed iter 103; its empty `New CA rule` cell remains a
  **trap, not an invitation** — sky is not cellular, and fog on terrain is already `rSea`/`fogAt`).
  **Cue (k) is now FULLY CLOSED**: 116 gave the sea a bottom (the *field* half) and **123 stood the wind farm
  on it** (the *siting* half) — 3/18 turbines were on the shelf, now 42/42 across 14 seeds, and the farm's line
  bends around headlands because the depth is held and the row is not. **What 123 leaves banked for Water** is
  the rest of the salted coast: the **pier** row and the **lifeguard tower** are still `rng()`-picked with
  rejection loops, and a boardwalk should run out to a *depth*. 123's second finding makes that free — **respend
  an object's existing `rng()` draws rather than re-drawing them**, and the stream cannot move.
  **123 ran the tell FORWARDS**, which is a new move: rather than making the draw honor a string, it made the
  string and the rule **share one constant** (`SHELF0`/`SHELF1` — the tooltip *names* the `Coastal shelf`, the
  wind farm *stands* on it), so the two cannot drift apart in the first place. Prefer this to re-syncing them
  later. Related, and the deeper prize: **a derived field earns its keep when a RULE reads it, not when the draw
  shows it.** `rDeep` was drawn by 116 and read by nothing until 123 sited on it. Still unread by any rule:
  **`rGreen`, `rShop`, `rServ`** feed only the walkable stat — *nothing sites itself against them.* **⚠ And a
  tick-rule CAN'T read them directly (iter 151): `recount()` runs only at init/warp/manual, never in the sim loop
  (L6342), so the reach maps are STALE inside `tick()`** — 151 cashed the seam's *shape* (a shop-distance rule)
  but recomputed it LOCALLY (`countAround` r2), so `rShop` per se is still unread (recompute it, or pay a recount).
  **Iteration 162 is the next holistic step-back** (105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 136, **142**, **147**, **152**, **157 done**, …).
  Shoot it **at night AND a season, and PIN THE DAY FRAME OFF JANUARY** (`year=2035.62` dry-peak baselines +
  `2035.02` as the seasonal-contrast frame — a default `?warp=61` frame is already ~winter; SKILL.md holds
  the full recipe). **130, 136, 142, 147, 152 AND 157 all found NO compounding city defect** (SIX clean bills in a row, the
  honest step-back outcome, no city change): both seeds PASS day/night/season, agents *located* the night core
  off-centre by light alone (157: (.48,.52) / (.48,.60), matching 152's (.47,.55)/(.44,.62); 115/143's lighting holds), 138's
  arterial night-corridors traced continuous both seeds, sea reads (116/123 hold), no tears/floaters/blowout;
  seasons measured alive (`probe-season`: FARM winter→dry-peak **88**, VINEYARD now moving too since 139, ROAD
  control ~0.5–2 — the *whole-frame* mildness agents feel is the by-design evergreen/irrigated dilution (120),
  a composition fact not a dead calendar). **The night-core-is-broad watch-item (136/142) is CASHED (iter 143,
  Urban × Polish): a `CORESIG=5` Gaussian bump on the CBD made the flat plateau a peak (`probe-nightcore`, detail
  archived); a stronger read widens the window mix `0.35+0.65·c.lit`, not `c.lit`.** (**125** = same shape, the pin-off-January recipe fix.)
  Iter 111 was People × Connect and used
  109's trick (close a gap between two existing objects); iter 112 **cashed the same trick in
  Transport** (trains ↔ their own stations) and iter 113 cashed it a third time in **Water** (the
  marsh ↔ the tide its own tooltip printed). **That shape has now paid in four domains — assume it is
  spent, and look for the gap-closing seam only where a tooltip/label already ASSERTS a relationship
  the draw ignores.** (That is the reliable tell: 111 a shelter, 112 a platform, 113 a live `Tide`.)
  **117 cashed the tell a fifth time and it is now the loop's most reliable move**: `TILEDESC` claimed
  *"Old-growth redwoods"* and *"Wild grass and wildflowers"* while `describeTile` printed only `Value`,
  though the CA had tracked `c.age`/`c.fire`/`c.bloom`/`c.shroom` since 1974. **Where else does a string
  assert what the code already knows?** **122 cashed it a sixth time** (`CIVICLABEL`'s one sub for twelve
  institutions) and found the tell is **self-renewing**: cashing it *created* a new one, since
  `TILEDESC[T.PLAZA]` still says only *"A paved civic square"* for a square that now knows its institution.
  **129 cashed it a seventh time** (the orchard's blossom/fruit calendar, mute in `describeTile` since iter 57 —
  now a `Grove` row) and confirmed its **limit**: of the three mute vegetation tooltips only the orchard's DRAW
  read `year`, so only it could be un-muted honestly — VINEYARD/GARDEN need a Deepen first (see 129).
  Un-cashed: `[T.IND]` *"warehouses and light industry"* (not vegetation, no calendar). `[T.VINEYARD]`
  *"terraced"* is now **CASHED (iter 148)** — a `Vines` season row off `vinePhase()`, mirroring 129's orchard;
  agriculture's mute-tooltip tell is now spent (only GARDEN remains and its draw is season-frozen, needs a
  Deepen first). The plaza/quad **titles** are now **CASHED (iter 140)** — an owned square's headline reads
  *"Town hall forecourt"* / *"Museum grounds"* outright.
  **122 also warns what the tell CANNOT do alone:** its first build derived ownership from *adjacency*, named
  the wrong institution on 2 of 3 seeds, and **passed the census and would have passed both visual agents** —
  the prose is only wrong if you know the geometry. **A tooltip vector needs a probe that checks the claim
  against independently recomputed truth, not just a screenshot that it renders.**
  Note iter 108 was Nature × Deepen but its
  *content* was a Sky interconnect (the farm calendar reads `applySeason`'s `year`) — **Sky can be
  fed by deepening another domain toward it**, which is the way out of its saturation that does not
  require a sky feature. **113 did this again** (the marsh reeds now read `year`), leaving 109's
  Sky-feedable list at `VINEYARD` and `MEADOW` seed-heads. **120 was a third instance** (the park lawns
  now read `year`) — and note it found `MEADOW` is only **6 tiles city-wide**, so a meadow vector buys
  almost no pixels. **Sky-feedable list is now EMPTY (iter 139 cashed `VINEYARD`)** — every vegetation tile
  that can read `year` now does; a further Sky interconnect must come from a genuinely new derived field, not
  from un-freezing another tile.

FOREST now moving via 156, night core located both seeds).** **158 Deepen (the OBSERVATORY DOME opens after dark and ROTATES to track the night sky — slit at the zenith at midnight, leaning to the horizons at dusk/dawn, shut by day; reads the slow `dayT` like the 149 clock & 135 moon; `__obs` locator, `probe-obsdome`).** **159 Deepen (the SURF GLOWS at night — bioluminescence sparkles the breaking wave with sparse soft sea-green DOTS, `LITAMT>0.5`-gated & `hashCell`-scattered, draw-only stream+pop-neutral; `probe-biolum` — the Water entry in the moon/stars/observatory night run).** Interaction/UX ran hot 133/134/140/141/144; 143/145/146/149/150/151/153/155/156/158/159 broke it to Polish/Deepen/Polish/Deepen/Polish/New-CA/Deepen/Deepen/New-element/Deepen/Deepen, 154 was Interaction/UX.
  **⚠ Iteration 162 is the next holistic STEP-BACK** (…/147/**152 done**/**157 done**/**162**) — not a domain lap; see the recipe
  below (night + season, day frame off January, interleaved perf). **155 took Transport × Deepen (the tram catenary, the
  149 draw-tell); 156 took Nature × New element (spring wildflower understory on the FOREST floor — 127's
  surface-not-entities law, forest=69 hexes vs garden=2). 157 was the mandated STEP-BACK; 158 took Civic × Deepen
  (the observatory dome rotates to track the night sky — 149's banked draw-tell); 159 took Water × Deepen (the surf
  glows at night, `probe-biolum`); the next lap (160) owes the stalest domain, Urban (151)**, then Sky (153). Sky is post-saturation (Deepen/Fix ONLY — its additive/CA cells are traps;
  the banked Sky move is the SEASON word, which needs a slow clock FIRST — see the moon note above). Urban's
  additive cell is spent (118). The coldest kind is **Scale** (a structural lever, not a lap move);
  **New element** was cashed at 127 (before that 106). Note 118's finding that a *saturated* domain cannot take a
  New element — but 127 sharpens it: saturation is of a domain's *entities*, and a New element can still land on a
  large untouched **surface** (127 put picnics on PARK, 145 a daily rhythm on the beach). Pick the domain first and
  read its row before choosing. **Connect** (last 111) is live and cheap: its trick is to add no new object.
  **Connect paid three times** (109, 111, 112 — 112 logged as
  Deepen, see its entry): its trick was that
  it added no new object — it *closed a gap between two that already existed* (see 109's first finding).
  Note **107 was a New CA rule that
  ADDED NOTHING**: it rewrote a pass that had never fired. *Auditing an existing rule for
  reachability* is a New-CA-rule move available in every domain and it costs no new content — see
  `probe-market.mjs` and the dead-rule law below. (Iter 106 passed on Connect/CA/Scale *for Water*
  and recorded why in its entry: Connect there means a corridor and iter 101's law kills those; a
  Water CA rule would repeat iter 90's dune accretion; Scale is a structural lever, not a lap move.
  That reasoning is Water-specific — the kinds stay cold for **other** domains.)
  Note **Nature × Connect was attempted and reverted three times** (46, 88,
  101) and is the row's graveyard: 46 found it geometrically impossible, 88 found it has no host
  draw-only, 101 found the host *and the land* and lost on **shape**. Do not re-open it as a
  *corridor*. **Cue (e½) is now CLOSED — iter 102 shipped the blob 101 prescribed** (the commons),
  so the interior has its lung; **do not plant a second one.** Nature's remaining cold cells are
  Connect (graveyard — leave it) and Scale.
- **⚠ `peds` CANNOT SERVE THE ROAD NETWORK (iter 111, measured, before writing any code).** A resident
  is leashed to the open cell it is anchored to (`PEDLEASH=2`, and `stepPed`'s comment says that
  constant was tuned to hold street occupancy at ~19%). Only **20–31%** of bus stops have a live ped's
  anchor within a leash — even at radius 5 it is 56–75%. So "residents walk to / wait at / ride the X"
  vectors are structurally capped at ~a quarter of any road-borne host, and would leave the rest
  *emptier* than whatever decoration they replaced. To do it properly you must move the **spawn pool**
  (`openCells` in `syncFleet`), not the leash. Don't rediscover this.
- **PERF BASELINE RE-PINNED 2026-07-10 (iter 105's step-back): day 33.16ms · night 37.33ms.** Held through
  iters 109/110/111/117 against pristine-HEAD controls (per-iter detail archived at 140/142). Not re-pinned
  since; day still reads flat against it, night now runs ~+2.2ms of real 137+138 draw plus load (see 142).
  **Iters 130/136 (step-backs): 126→135 cost ZERO** (130 −0.5% both vs iter-125 `c63e43b`; 136 +0.1% vs iter-130
  `f2aa721`; night +7% vs the STORED baseline proven load both). **147: 143→146 cost ZERO**; **152: 143→151 cost
  ZERO** (both vs iter-142 `ce17d61`, min/variant, all flat — detail archived). **157: 152→156 cost ZERO** —
  HEAD-156 vs iter-152 (`be84b49`, A/B/A/B min/variant) day **37.66 vs 36.39 (+3.5%, inside the day noise floor:
  same HEAD bytes read 43.2 then 37.7)**, night **42.83 vs 42.66 (+0.4%, flat)**; `perf.mjs` vs stored baseline
  read +30%/+39% (pure load). **The day column is the noisy one on this box — grade it ONLY by min-of-≥2-rounds
  interleave; night is steady.** The stored-baseline false-FAIL is now a **SEVEN-time pattern
  (125→130→136→142→147→152→157)** — always understates today's load; the interleave-against-an-old-commit reading is
  the only honest step-back grade, and it is **NOT re-pinned** (baking today's load in would blind the gate).
  (**A 2-round day+night interleave overruns the 120s Bash timeout — `run_in_background` it.** Filter the
  perf-mean grep to `p95` lines or it swallows "vs baseline" and corrupts the min. **⚠ `cp` is aliased `-i`
  here — use `/bin/cp` or every swap silently no-ops and you measure ONE file 4×, iter 147.**)
  **142 (step-back): the interleave found a small but REAL cost — the first non-flat step-back delta.** `perf.mjs`
  read day 34.34 (+3.6%) / night 40.83 (+9.4% vs stored baseline); interleaved HEAD-141 vs iter-136 (`6b31425`,
  A/B/A/B, min per variant): day **34.44 vs 34.50** (−0.2%, flat) but night **41.39 vs 40.50** (**+2.2%**). That
  +2.2% night is 137's figure contact-shadows (day+night) + **138's per-arterial night lamps landing** — small,
  expected (138's own finding flagged night), well inside budget (60fps 100% / 30fps 47.7%), NOT a regression to
  fix and NOT re-pinned. **Night is the one to watch** (118 added per-window
  lit-pane draws; 138 added ~88-hex arterial strokes at night).
  **⚠ 117 CORRECTED 99's DIAGNOSTIC.** The old rule read *"a **stable** pass-over-pass offset means code,
  a **rising** one means load."* **The stable half is FALSE**: machine load is autocorrelated over
  minutes, so three passes inside one loaded window are three samples of *one* draw. Iter 117's gate read
  **+25.5 / +26.0 / +26.5%** — perfectly stable — on a diff with **zero draw calls**, and the identical
  bytes read **+3.5%** twenty minutes later. **Never grade frame time by consecutive passes at all.** The
  only sound reading is **interleaved A/B/A/B against pristine HEAD** (swap `solvista.html` between every
  pass, min per variant) — and brace the shell interpolation, because `/tmp/$v117.html` silently measures
  one variant six times. 99's *remedy* (control against pristine HEAD, not the baseline file) stands, and
  "code" may still be earlier iterations' code. Re-pin at a step-back whenever the offset survives an
  interleaved control; `polish-tile` owns the file, so say so in the entry rather than re-pinning silently.
- **`?year=` IS NOW A URL HOOK (iter 108) — the seasons are finally testable.** `window.__setYear`
  had existed since the season pass but was **never wired to the query string**, so no screenshot in
  this loop's history could pin a *calendar* position: `?warp=61` from `year=1974` always lands on
  ~2035.0, i.e. **every shot ever taken of this city was in January.** Now
  `?seed=42&warp=61&year=2035.62` pins high summer. Applied *after* `warp` (warp advances `year`).
  Use `.02 / .30 / .62 / .87` for winter / spring / the golden dry peak / autumn — those are
  `applySeason`'s own keyframes. An unreachable test hook is the same defect class as iter 107's
  unreachable rule: **grep the URL block before assuming a hook you can see is a hook you can use.**
- **`?tide=` IS NOW A URL HOOK (iter 113) — the sea is testable, and every prior shot was a lie about it.**
  Same story as `?year=` one dimension over: `TIDE` runs a ~2 min seeded cycle and **no screenshot in this
  loop's history could pin it.** The default is seeded, not neutral — **`?seed=42` loads at TIDE 0.02, dead
  low water.** `?tide=v` shifts the cycle's *phase* (`__setTide`), so the sea keeps moving from where you put
  it rather than freezing. Use `.02 / .35 / .59 / .98` = low / mid-ebb / **neutral** / high. **`0.59` is the
  pin you want when grading anything ELSE on a marsh**: it sits below the flood-sheen cut (0.60) and at
  `ebb=0`, so the hex body is one flat color and nothing tidal can move.
- **`c.buzz` — the third derived field, after `c.flow` and `c.val` (iter 104, in `tick()`).** How much
  is there to come out FOR, seen from a hex: `ATTRACT.has(c.t)?2:0` plus a count of `ATTRACT`
  neighbours (`COM`/`MARKET`/`CIVIC`/`STADIUM`/`PLAZA`). Pure terrain derivation, no `rng()`,
  recomputed each tick. It is sparse — **mean 0.54–0.59 over standable hexes, and mostly 0** — so a
  rule keyed to it changes behaviour *only* near attractions and is a no-op across the rest of the
  city. Reuse it for anything meaning "somewhere worth standing"; don't hand-roll a second one.
  **⚠ `c.buzz` is NOT `PEDDEST`** — an attraction field must EXCLUDE the ground you stand on
  (`PEDDEST` is mostly open park, so its argmax is a lawn interior, not a shopfront kerb); see
  iter 104's archived note before re-deriving.
- **The CBD is published: `CBDX`/`CBDY` + `CORER`=16 (iter 98, L215).** `genWorld` has always laid a
  founding crossroads (`mainX`,`fy`) and grown the old town around it; it stayed local for 97
  iterations, so **no rule knew where downtown was**. Note `c.val` is *not* a centrality field — it
  diffuses `valueSrc`, whose peaks sit on **parks and water** (0.92/0.74), not on the core. Anything
  that means "near downtown" should use `hexDist(x,y,CBDX,CBDY)`, not `c.val` and not `CTRX/CTRY`
  (the plate's centre, which is not the city's).
- **⚠ The plate is a HEXAGON, not a square (U4):** `G` (=67) is only the bounding
  box the `cells` array lives in; the live plate is the `HEXR`=33 rings masked by
  `HEXOK`, and everything outside it is `T.VOID`. So: never loop `0..G` and assume
  a live cell — `inB()` gates it, `cellAt()` returns `null` off-plate, and a seeded
  random cell must come from **`HEXI`** (the live-cell list) or it lands in a dead
  corner. Each row's live span is `ROWMIN[y]`/`ROWMAX[y]`; the coast and its craft
  clamp to those. Per-tick development attempts are scaled by `KS`=1.46 because the
  plate carries ~46% more land than the old 48×48 square — a new per-tick placement
  loop should scale with `ks(n)` too, or it will fill proportionally slower.
- **⚠ Monorail and cable cars are PLURAL (U4):** `monos` / `gonds` are *lists* of
  independently grown lines, each closing its own loop. The old singular `monorail`,
  `monoPath`, `monoClosed`, `gond`, `gondPath` are gone — code written against them
  will silently read `undefined`.
- **Traffic flow exists — `c.flow` + `ARTFLOW` (iter 77).** `trafficFlow()` runs each
  tick: trips are generated by developed hexes and drain along the road network to the
  value core, accumulating like a river's drainage tree. `c.flow` is that accumulated
  load; `flow>=ARTFLOW` (64) is an **arterial** (~15% of roads, ~97/city). Unlike `busy`
  (a *local* ≥3-developed-neighbours test that calls a third of the city an avenue),
  flow is a **network** measure — ~200 high-flow roads are not `busy` and vice versa.
  **Bridges come out as the trunks unprompted** (seed 42's global max, 635, is a bridge
  deck), and the spine is connected: 153 of 155 arterial hexes touch another. `__find`
  now answers `'arterial'`. Reuse `c.flow` for anything that should follow the main
  roads — don't hand-roll a second notion of "important street". **Iter 80 is the
  first reuse:** civic forecourts pick the lot fronting the loudest street.
  **⚠ But flow is a bad host for *land use* (iter 82).** `RES→COM` on arterial
  frontage produced 85% **singletons** — by the time a street carries flow its
  frontage is already `COM`/`MID`/`TOWER`, so the houses left to convert are
  scattered. Flow suits *point* decisions (which lot fronts the loudest street) far
  better than *linear* ones (grow a high street). Don't re-try RES→COM on arterials.
- **Institutions now cluster: `MAJORK` / `QUARTER` / `siteQuarter()` (iter 91).** `MAJORK` =
  the five monumental kinds (`hall museum parliament university library`) — it is the shared
  vocabulary for "major institution", used by **both** the civic quarter and the 2020+
  forecourt rule (which previously inlined the same five-way test). `QUARTER` = the three
  that *seek* the quarter (`library museum parliament`, at 1982/1997/2034); services (school,
  police, firehouse, hospital, aquarium, amphitheater, observatory) stay sited by need, and
  `observatory` is deliberately left free to sit at the rim. `siteQuarter()` hugs the nearest
  standing major at `QNEAR..QFAR` = **2–4 hexes** — near enough to share a street, far enough
  to leave one between (adjacency would kill the bunting, which needs a ROAD cell reachable
  from two civics). It falls back to the scattered search when the core is walled in, so
  `civicKinds` never drops. **Two existing systems light up for free:** festival bunting
  (iter 45) roughly **doubles-to-triples** (fete 9→16, 6→18 per city), and downtown builds
  **taller** because three clustered civics choke one COM quorum instead of three.
- **A forecourt is now SHARED, by construction (iter 91).** The 2020+ rule skips a civic with a
  `PLAZA` within 2 hexes, and quarter members sit 2–4 apart — so the quarter gets **one** square,
  not four (`PLAZA 14→10` across the matrix). That is defensible urbanism and was accepted, but
  it is the one place the vector *cost* something. See open cue (d).
- **Open cues, banked by holistic passes (take one when its domain comes up):**
  **(l) CLOSED (iter 133) — hover-tile focus ring + the thin-stroke legibility law: both in GROWTH-archive.md (iter 157 trim).**
  **(e½) the interior is an edge-to-edge carpet — now DENSITY-ONLY** *(cue (e)'s skyline half was
  **CLOSED by iter 98**; its **palette** half was **CLOSED by iter 99**)* Urban fabric — iter 94's
  holistic agent called the landmass "too uniform… little breathing room between core and edge,"
  and the interior an "edge-to-edge carpet of roads + rooftops with little green breathing room."
  **98 fixed the skyline; 99 fixed the colour; 100 put the first *earned* green in the interior
  (7–10 `QUAD` hexes behind the institutions) — but it did NOT add a lung.** Iter 100's step-back
  agent, reading the whole frame: the interior *"does breathe… but green is fragmented into small
  patches rather than any real district-scale lung,"* and its top recommendation was to
  **consolidate green into one or two district-scale parks/greenways** instead of more scatter.
  That, plus mid-block density, is exactly what remains. Note iter 100 spent −1.03% pop for 23
  cells, so a district-scale park is affordable but not free.
  **Iter 101 attacked this and REVERTED — read its findings before re-trying.** It settled three
  things and cost nothing: (i) **`PARK` is permanent** — nothing in `tick()` consumes one, so green
  planted in `genWorld` survives to 2035, and the "plant it early" host iter 88 hoped for is real;
  (ii) green costs about **0.045% pop per cell** and partly repays it, because `PARK` is the top
  `valueSrc` (0.92) and lifts the frontage it faces (`cafes` +141, `COM` +51); (iii) **the lung must
  be a BLOB, not a ribbon** — a 1–2 hex corridor is untraceable at frame scale whatever its contrast
  (see the law at the top). So: ~50 contiguous cells, **≥3 hexes across**, sited by
  `hexDist(x,y,CBDX,CBDY)`, not by `c.val`. The greenway's flag/tooltip/half-segment path draw and
  its contiguity probe were all correct — only the shape was wrong.
  Heed iter 92 (never zone against `TOWER` near the core: −9.8% pop) **and** iter 98
  (the upgrade probability *saturates*, so leaning on `p` is a weak lever that costs towers at 240
  pop each). A `MID`/`RES` thinning rule, or interior parks, is likelier than anything touching
  towers. **This is the first (e½) move that must change tiles, so it cannot be stream-neutral —
  budget for a few % of chaotic wobble and judge it on the tile histogram.**
  The same agent flagged seed 1234's long straight monorail/cable
  lines as still reading like a "wireframe/UI stroke" — but iters 85/87 closed that with two
  agents each, so treat this as one un-zoomed opinion, **not** a reopening of cue (c).
  **(g) THIRTEEN lines / SIXTEEN seedless `hashCell` calls remain** — **iter 103's audit grep undercounted,
  and iter 113 corrected it.** The old pattern
  (`grep -nE 'hashCell\([^)]*,[[:space:]]*(0x)?[0-9]+\)' … | grep -v seedNum`) matches only a **bare integer**
  salt, so every `k+90` / `j+40` / `r*3+cc+50` form was invisible to it — including **two of the marsh's own
  three offenders.** Use the superset:
  `grep -noE 'hashCell\([^;]{0,60}' solvista.html | grep -v seedNum` (then discard the L182 definition and
  genWorld's L510/511/523, which pass the real `seed`). Each survivor is a function of `(x,y[,j])` alone, so
  it paints the identical pattern in every city. Two stakes, and **only the first is an invariant breach
  worth a vector**:
  - **Presence decisions** (something is there, or isn't, in the same place in every city):
    **L2747** `hashCell(x,y,77)<0.28` — which surf cells catch the city's light-smear at night.
  - **Ornament jitter** (a detail's lean/length/brightness, not its existence): kelp sway **L2799**,
    palm fronds **L2832 ×2 / L2834 ×2**, orchard fruit **L3248/3249**, **park fireflies L3423 ×2**
    (identical firefly positions in every city), **L3610/3613**, **L5113/5117**.
    The marsh reed tufts were **CLOSED by iter 113** (and its lean salt `hashCell(x,j,7)` took no `y`, so
    every marsh hex in a column leaned identically). The tower window-lights
    (`hashCell(x,z|0,3|5|9|13)` — every city's towers lit identically at night, the *most visible*
    of the class) were **CLOSED by iter 110**, folded into its TOWER Polish; they now mix `seedNum`.
  Note `darkWinR` is **not** a breach: it takes a literal `salt` argument but mixes `seedNum^salt`
  internally — check the callee before indicting a call site. And when you fix a range, **space the bases**:
  `0x9EE1+j` / `0x9EE2+j` / `0x9EE3` collide at `j=2` (iter 113).
  **(i) the marsh reeds do not read, and that is a `polish-tile` job** *(banked by iter 113, Water)* —
  the reed calendar shipped in 113 is wired and measurable, but the reeds are **seven sub-pixel strokes
  huddled around the pool**, so the hex reads as "green hex with a pool" and the calendar is invisible at
  fit zoom. (Verified by marking them magenta — see 113's findings; the striking pale figure on a marsh
  hex is a **heron**, not a reed.) Spreading/lengthening them is a tile redesign, out of scope for a
  growth lap, and it would pay off immediately because the seasonal color is already computed.
  **(d) the civic quarter's real square — CLOSED, MEASURED DEAD (iter 131; do not re-open — a ≥3-hex civic
  square is geometrically impossible at the quarter, `probe-quarter.mjs`; full reasoning archived at iter 142).**
- **Reach maps exist — reuse them (U5):** `reachFill(out, r, isSrc)` is a
  multi-source hex BFS capped at radius `r`, walking over land only (`WETSET` blocks
  water/marsh/kelp), filling `out` with steps-to-nearest-source and 255 for "farther
  than r". `recount()` already runs four per tick (transit / green / shop / service).
  Any "how far is X from Y" question should call it rather than hand-rolling a flood
  fill. Cost is ~1ms per `recount()`, which is per *tick*, not per frame.
- **⚠ Three census stats can FALL, by design (U5):** `walkPct`, `transitPct` and
  `solarPct` are shares of residents/roofs, not counts. Green space and shops
  saturate >90% on their own, so **services are walkable's binding constraint** — a
  tower lap that adds residents without civics will *drop* `walkPct`, and that is
  the stat working, not a regression. Judge them by whether the city earned the
  change, not by "up = good". `density` (residents per developed hex) rises with
  intensification and falls with sprawl.

## Iteration 150 — the open sea catches the sun (2026-07-11) [Water & coast × Polish]

**Vector.** Water & coast × **Polish** — Water was the stalest domain (last SHIP 141), and the kind varied off
the recent Deepen/Interaction-UX run (146/149 + the hot IUX laps) to **Polish**, its own kind (last 132). This
is a fill-the-gap Polish, not a banked cue: by DAY the open sea — a third of the canvas — carried only a faint
uniform sparkle (one foam stroke on ~2/7 cells) and the beach surf. There was **no sun on the water**: the
midday ocean read as flat teal, while the night already has its warm city-light smear (L3057). The lesson
this closes is the coast's daytime blank, not the salted-pier cue (123, still banked).

**The seam.** `case T.WATER` draw (L3029). The existing daytime sparkle (L3031) and the night city-smear (L3057)
bracket the spot; I added a day-only layer between them. `dayT` (slow ~110 s day clock) and `LITAMT` (0 by day,
up at night) were already in scope, as was `colA('glint',...)` — the cool-white specular color, distinct from
warm `foam`.

**Change (draw-only, ~14 lines, added not replacing).** A `glit=(1-LITAMT)·max(0,1-|dayT-0.47|/0.30)` factor —
1 at noon, 0 before dusk, 0 all night — gates a shimmer layer over open water (`!c.riv`): slow cool bands drift
seaward (`sin((x·0.9+y·0.5)-waveT·0.55)`) and **lift the whole hex tone** with a translucent `hexTile` wash
(α≤0.16), with brighter sparkle strokes riding each band's crest. No tile, entity, `rng()`, `hashCell`, `tick()`
pass or terrain; strings pure-ASCII (134). Night is byte-unchanged (glit=0 → the block draws nothing); pop
provably flat.

**Two-pass tuning (logged per the counterweight).** The FIRST build used only 1px cool strokes (no wash). It
passed the census but **both visual agents, blind, reported the sea as "flat uniform teal — glitter not
visible"** — the contrast×width law (fine speckle averages to nothing at fit zoom). Strengthened to the
tone-lifting **sheet** (a full-hex wash reads at any zoom); both seeds then PASS. The weak version was never
shipped — reverted in-place before the sheet.

**Census.** PASS, exit 0, pageerrors 0. Tile histogram empty, all core metrics +0, entity counts identical
(cars 360 · trams 54 …). Vacuous by construction (a draw reading globals runs in no census metric) — the probe
is the gate.

**Probe.** `probes/probe-glitter.mjs` (new, promoted). Self-contained, no build-vs-build: freeze the clock AND
pin `waveT` to a constant (so foam/surf/sparkle cancel), render the SAME artifact at noon (glit=1) vs morning
(glit=0), and count pixels the noon frame pushed toward cool white (min-channel +≥12) over the OPEN-SEA box vs
an inland LAND box. seeds 7/42/1234: **sea = 43520 / 43306 / 42122** (mean **42983**), **land control = 7 / 5 /
6** (mean **6**). The morning frame draws no glitter by construction (glit=0), so that ~7000:1 ratio is the
day-only sheet, confined to the sea. (An earlier build-vs-build probe read dirty controls — two page loads
differ in `waveT` and Math.random entities — which is why the self-contained same-build, pinned-`waveT` diff is
the honest form; see findings.)

**Visual.** Coast + whole-city `wide` at seeds 42 & 7, one agent each: both **VISUAL: PASS** — cool shimmer /
brighter drifting bands "clearly perceptible as sunlit water," "not milky / not blown-out / not a film," no
z-order tears or floaters, the frame still a balanced coastal city. (The first, faint build's two FAILs are
logged above.)

**Verdict — SHIPPED.** The daytime open sea now catches the sun — a cool shimmer sheet that peaks at noon and
fades to nothing by dusk, handing off cleanly to the night's warm city smear. Draw-only, day-only, pop provably
flat. Water's Polish cell gains its next (U2, 44, 58, 79, 116, 132, **150**).

### Findings for later laps
- **A FINE-SPECKLE OCEAN EFFECT IS INVISIBLE AT FIT ZOOM — LIFT THE TILE TONE INSTEAD (contrast×width, again).**
  1px cool strokes on ~2/5 of sea cells read as "flat teal" to two blind agents; a translucent full-hex `hexTile`
  wash (a tone lift) reads at any zoom because it has area, not sub-pixel width. For a broad water/sky field,
  reach for a tone wash first and let sparkle strokes ride ON it, not instead of it.
- **A BUILD-vs-BUILD SEA PROBE IS CONFOUNDED; USE SAME-BUILD, PINNED-`waveT`, TWO-CLOCK DIFF.** Diffing patched
  vs pristine across two page loads gave controls of 300–560 (not ~0) because the two loads froze at different
  `waveT` (foam/surf animate with it) and spawned different Math.random entities (boats/surfers). Fix: measure
  ONE build, set `waveT` to a constant in-page, and diff two clock states whose only real difference is the
  feature's own gate (here glit at noon vs morning) — controls dropped to ~6. `waveT` is an assignable global,
  so a probe can pin it exactly like `playing=false` pins the clock.
- **A DAY-ONLY LIGHTING LAYER GATED BY `(1-LITAMT)·<midday bump>` COSTS THE NIGHT NOTHING AND HOLDS THE MEAN
  over a full day** (iter 98's law): it only ever *adds* brightness, and only by day, so the night frame is
  byte-identical (glit=0) and the sea's tone returns to base by dusk. This is the clean template for "the sun
  does X to the sea/sky" without a permanent tone drift.

## Iteration 151 — the block grows its own corner shop (2026-07-11) [Urban fabric × New CA rule]

**Vector.** Urban fabric × **New CA rule** — Urban was the single stalest domain (last SHIP 143), 118's law
forbids a New element there (additive inventory surveyed spent), and the header steered the kind: vary off
Polish (150) and Deepen (149), *"Connect/New-CA fresh."* The content came from the banked reach-field seam
(*"nothing sites itself against `rShop`/`rGreen`/`rServ` — a derived field earns its keep when a RULE reads
it"*): a rule keyed to shop-distance. The city has no **neighbourhood retail** — a house too deep in the
fabric to reach a shop had nowhere to buy milk; the walkable stat measured the gap (rShop) but nothing filled it.

**The seam, and the recount trap.** `recount()` populates `rShop` (r3 to COM/MARKET, L2086) but is **NOT called
inside the per-tick sim loop** (L6342) — only at init/warp/manual — so `rShop` is *stale during `tick()`* and a
tick-rule can't read it without a per-tick `recount()` (the reason the seam sat banked). The fresh equivalent
is **local**: `countAround(x,y,r, COM||MARKET)`. Shops saturate >90% (the U5 note), so a full r3 desert is rare
(2–5/city); I used **r2** ("no shop within a short walk") for coverage (8–9 mid-century).

**Change (~14-line tick pass + ~13-line draw + 3-line tooltip).** A house on a built-up block (`≥3 DEV`
neighbours) with **no COM/MARKET within 2** opens a store on its ground floor: `c.corner=true`. It **stays
`T.RES`** — mixed-use, exactly like the `c.loft`/`c.solar`/`c.groof` flag idiom — so *no tile type changes*.
The decision is `hashCell`-gated (no `rng()`), and `c.corner` is read only by the draw + tooltip, never by an
rng()-gated pass, so both **setting AND clearing** it are stream-neutral. The pass **re-validates**: a store is
absorbed (`c.corner=false`) once the growing city plants a real shop within 2, so *"in a retail gap"* holds at
every tick, not just at placement. One store per gap falls out of the fixed-order live-mutating pass (first
qualifier vetoes any other within 2). The RES draw grafts a storefront on the road face with the COM draw's own
helpers (`bandR` glass, `slotS` door, `awnS` awning) sized to the RES body, a **green grocer's awning** ('sage')
to mark it apart, and a night-lit fascia. `describeTile` titles it *"Corner shop"*.

**A `RES→COM` conversion was tried FIRST and REVERTED.** The obvious form — flip the house to `T.COM` — passed
the census but the tile histogram swung hard (TOWER **−32**, MID **+33**, FOREST/MEADOW −13, …): changing `c.t`
flips which branch of the **fire** pass (`RES||COM && age>26 && rng()<…`) and the **upgrade** pass runs, changing
their `rng()` **call counts** and reshuffling the whole downstream stream — even though the *decision* used
`hashCell`. The flag-on-RES form moves the histogram by **nothing** (all core +0, empty histogram). See findings.

**Census.** PASS, exit 0, pageerrors 0. Fully vacuous — every core metric **+0**, tile histogram **empty**,
entity counts identical. Stream-neutral AND pop-neutral by construction (no `c.t` change).

**Probe** `probes/probe-cornershop.mjs` (new, promoted). Per 122's law it checks placement against truth
**recomputed independently in Node** (its own odd-r cube hex-distance, not the page's `countAround`): every
corner shop's nearest real COM/MARKET is **> 2** hexes (control: `nearShop` must be 0), no two corners within 2
(spacing), all title *"Corner shop"* with **0** false hits over 200 plain-RES, none before the rule's 1990 start,
and identical count+positions on reload (determinism). **3/3 seeds PASS:** 2035 counts 5/5/4, all in a gap, min
pair 3–7, naming 5/5·5/5·4/4, plain false-hits 0. Caught two real bugs on the way: the first `RES→COM` build
(histogram swing) and encroachment — an early r3 non-revalidating form let the growing city plant a COM beside an
old corner (seed 42: 2 of 4 within 3), fixed by the re-validating clear.

**Visual.** `probes/shot-cornershop.mjs` (new) camera-zooms onto a corner shop (found via `__find('RES')` filtered
by `c.corner`) day + night, clipped against the plain terraces; plus whole-city `wide` at seeds 42 & 7. One agent
per seed, locate-don't-judge (108): **both VISUAL: PASS** — the green-awning glass storefront reads clearly as a
small shop grafted onto a house, distinct from the plain pitched-roof terraces, awning projecting to the street
(grounded on its hex, not stabbing a neighbour), night storefront lit; no z-order tears/floaters/blowout; both
whole-city frames balanced and coherent. Both noted the night fascia is lit-but-not-strongly-emissive — a minor
legibility nuance, not a fault (over-brightening one hex risks a blown dot).

**Verdict — SHIPPED.** The city grows its own neighbourhood retail: a house in a shop desert opens a corner
store on its ground floor, and it's absorbed when the shops reach it — a living urban process, guaranteed clean
(stream + pop neutral). Urban's `New CA rule` cell gains its next (7, 23, ~~82~~, **151**); Urban is no longer
stalest. `rShop` per se stays banked (I read a local r2 twin, not `rShop`), but the *shape* — a rule keyed to
shop-distance — is now cashed.

### Findings for later laps
- **A TYPE CHANGE (`c.t=…`) IS NEVER STREAM-NEUTRAL, EVEN WITH A `hashCell` DECISION — a FLAG on the existing
  tile is.** The reshuffle isn't from *your* pass calling `rng()`; it's that flipping `c.t` changes which
  rng()-gated BRANCH a *later* pass takes (the fire pass keys on `RES||COM`, the upgrade pass branches by type),
  so their `rng()` **call counts** shift and the downstream stream reshuffles. The file's own idiom
  (`c.loft`/`c.solar`/`c.groof`) is the escape: set a boolean on a tile whose type never changes, read it only in
  the draw/tooltip, and the census is vacuous. Reach for a flag before a conversion whenever the feature can be
  mixed-use rather than a demolition.
- **A REACH FIELD (`rShop`/`rGreen`/`rServ`) IS STALE INSIDE `tick()` — `recount()` runs only at init/warp/manual,
  never in the sim loop.** A tick-rule that wants "distance to nearest X" must recompute it LOCALLY
  (`countAround`), or pay a per-tick `recount()` (~1ms × hundreds of warp ticks). This is *why* the "nothing sites
  itself against the reach fields" seam sat banked — the fields aren't available where a rule would read them. The
  local `countAround` twin is the practical substitute; note it's your chosen radius, not necessarily rShop's 3.
- **A RE-VALIDATING FLAG PASS KEEPS ITS OWN INVARIANT TRUE FOREVER, which lets the probe's control stay strict.**
  Because setting *and clearing* `c.corner` are both stream-neutral, the pass can clear the flag when the world
  grows past the condition (a shop reaches within 2 → the store is absorbed). So "every corner sits in a gap"
  holds at 2035, not just at placement — the encroachment bug (a persistent flag the city outgrows) simply cannot
  occur, and the probe can assert the clean control on final state. Do this for any flag whose siting condition
  the evolving city can later violate.

## Iteration 152 — the tenth step-back finds a clean city, perf flat (2026-07-11) [holistic step-back]

**Vector.** Holistic **step-back** (the mandated 152 in the 105/110/115/120/125/130/136/142/147/**152** cadence)
— not a domain lap. Read the WHOLE city at 2 seeds × 3 lights/calendars for cumulative drift the census can't
see (clutter, darkness, z-order tears, floaters, blowout, a dead calendar), plus the interleaved perf gate.

**Frames.** seeds 42 & 7, each at day (`t=0.35`) / night (`t=0.9`) / winter (`t=0.35,year=2035.02`), day &
night PINNED off January at `year=2035.62` (the dry peak) so the baseline frames sit at a different calendar
point than the winter-contrast frame (the 125 trap). `wide` whole-city, un-zoomed.

**Census / seasons.** Regression census PASS (exit 0, 0 pageerrors, every metric flat — no edit this iter).
`probe-season`: seasons alive — FARM winter→dry-peak **88.4**, VINEYARD moving (44.6/36.7/42.7 — 139 holds),
ORCHARD 25/18/41, FOREST/PARK/SHOREPARK all shifting, ROAD control ~0.5–2.2. The calendar is not frozen.

**Perf (interleaved, run alone).** HEAD (146+151) vs iter-142 control `ce17d61`, A/B/A/B ×3, min per variant:
day **35.0 vs 34.33 (+2.0%)**, night **41.22 vs 41.44 (−0.5%)** — both flat/within noise. **143→151 cost ~zero.**
(As the five prior step-backs found, `perf.mjs` vs the STORED baseline over-reads night as load; the
interleave-against-an-old-commit is the honest grade, and the baseline stays UN-re-pinned so the gate can't be
blinded by today's load.)

**Visual (one agent per seed, locate-don't-judge).** BOTH **VISUAL: PASS**. Both seeds read as balanced,
legible coastal cities in all three frames — dense-but-legible core, clean beach/water transition, river,
parks/farms giving the eye rest; no z-order tears, floaters, seams, or blown-out/oversaturated color in any
frame; night dim-not-murky. Agents LOCATED the night core by light alone: seed 42 **(0.47, 0.55)**, seed 7
**(0.44, 0.62)** — matching 147's (.47,.50)/(.47,.62) and 143's CBD Gaussian peak; the lighting model holds.
Both saw a real day↔winter vegetation tone shift (muted olive/tan tilled fields & canopy in winter vs saturated
dry-season greens) — the calendar reads visually, not just in the probe.

**Verdict — no city change (clean bill).** The **fifth consecutive clean holistic step-back** (130/136/142/147/152
all found NO compounding city defect). No watch-item survives: the night-core-broad item was cashed at 143
(`CORESIG`), seasons measured alive, perf flat, sea/arterial-corridor reads hold (116/123/138). Per the skill,
a step-back that finds no defect ships nothing — logging the clean bill IS the outcome. **153 owes the stalest
domain (Sky, last 144 — Deepen/Fix only, the SEASON word still needs a slow clock first), then People (145),
then Nature (148).**

## Iteration 153 — the stars fade under a full moon (2026-07-11) [Sky & atmosphere × Deepen]

**Vector.** Sky & atmosphere × **Deepen** (SHIPPED). Rotation named the domain — Sky was the single stalest (last
144) — and the header's standing fence rules out its additive/CA cells (traps) and its one banked move (the
SEASON word, still needs a slow clock, do not re-ship 134). So a Deepen that adds no element: an *interconnect*
between two mature Sky systems that never talked. **Probed the seam first (119's law):** the night star field
(render, ~L5491) faded only with `LITAMT` and **completely ignored `MOONF`** — `probe-starmoon` measured
`corr(starLum, MOONF)=0.000` across a 12-sample moon-phase sweep at a fixed night. Astronomically wrong: a
bright full moon washes all but the brightest stars out; a new moon reveals the field.

**Change (~10 lines, draw-only, stream-neutral).** (1) Gave each `STARS` entry a 4th field — an intrinsic
magnitude (`Math.random()`, at module load; touches no seeded `rng()`) — so moonlight thins the FAINT stars
first. (2) In the draw, multiply each star's alpha by `starWash = 1−0.62·MOONF` and by `(0.6+0.8·mg)` (mean
1.0). `MOONF` is the moon's own lit fraction, already computed at L5486 and read by the disc, the moonglade and
the moon HUD — this is **another reader of the one predicate** (144's law), so the stars cannot drift from the
moon that's drawn. The `(0.6+0.8·mg)` mean-1.0 spread keeps the **new-moon** field at its old average
brightness, so the well-vetted dark-night look is unchanged and only *thins* as the moon fills. No tile, entity,
`rng()`, `tick()` pass or terrain — pop provably flat; no `ENTINFO`/census-hook change (stars aren't a hover
entity). Per-frame cost: 70 stars × two extra multiplies — nil.

**Census.** PASS, exit 0. Draw-only, stream-neutral — tile histogram empty, core metrics flat (life/transport
wobble is the documented chaotic-CA headless noise). Vacuous by construction; the probe is the gate.

**Probe — `probes/probe-starmoon.mjs` (new, promoted).** A moon-phase SWEEP at a FIXED time of day: `daylight`
reads `dayT mod 1` so sweeping `dayT=k+0.90` (k=0..11, deep night) holds the sky, `LITAMT` and the frozen
twinkle IDENTICAL and varies ONLY the moon (`moonPhase` reads raw `dayT/8`). Result: **HEAD `corr(star,MOONF)`
= 0.000** (the defect) → **patched −0.99 / −0.87** (seed 7 / 42; bright moon dims the field). **Ground control**
(city-core patch, lit by `LITAMT` not the moon) `corr = 0.000` both builds — the change is confined to the sky.

**Visual.** New-moon vs full-moon night wide frames per seed (found the extremal `t` per seed via `__moon().illum`:
s42 NEW t=7.90 / FULL t=3.90; s7 NEW t=4.90 / FULL t=0.90), one agent each, asked to DISCRIMINATE which frame has
the richer star field (108's locate-don't-judge). **2/2 chose the NEW-moon frame** (seed 42 blind), matching the
intended effect; both confirmed no z-order tears / floating tiles / blown-out colour anywhere, both whole frames
balanced night coastal cities. Seed 7 noted the effect is "very subtle at this zoom" — expected (143's
pixel-vs-field magnitude law + the wide downscale), directionally correct and artifact-free.

**Verdict — SHIPPED.** The diorama's night sky is now internally consistent: the same `MOONF` that fills the disc
and lights the moonglade now washes the stars out, so a full-moon night reads pale and sparse while a new moon is
brilliant. Draw-only, stream-neutral, pop flat, another reader of the moon predicate. Sky's Deepen cell gains its
seventh (19, 35, 50, 57, 95, 135, **153**); Sky is no longer stalest (People 145 now is).

### Findings for later laps
- **`MOONF` IS NOW A FOUR-READER FIELD — reuse it, don't re-derive.** The moon's lit fraction feeds the disc, the
  moonglade, the moon HUD (144) and now the star wash. Anything that should respond to moonlight (a future
  night-sky-glow, a moonlit-water tweak, dimmer aurora) should read `MOONF` at L5486, not recompute a phase.
- **THE MOON-PHASE SWEEP-AT-FIXED-NIGHT is the probe shape for any moon-driven feature.** `daylight` reads
  `dayT mod 1` but `moonPhase` reads raw `dayT/8`, so `dayT=k+0.90` (integer k) holds time-of-day/`LITAMT`
  IDENTICAL and sweeps ONLY the moon — a clean control for isolating a moon response from the day cycle.
  `probe-starmoon` does it; reuse it. (And to shoot a matched new-vs-full pair, the extremal `t` is per-seed —
  the phase carries a `seedNum` offset — so query `__moon().illum` over k=0..7 to pick them, don't assume `t=0.9`
  is any particular phase.)
- **Sky's SEASON word is STILL the only banked Sky move and STILL fenced.** This Deepen was a moon↔stars
  interconnect, NOT the season readout. The season word still reads the fast `year` (strobes ~0.7 Hz, 134) and
  needs a slow clock or quantize/hold FIRST. Sky's additive/CA cells remain traps; the next Sky lap wanting a
  *new* interconnect should look for another mature-but-disconnected pair, as this did.

## Iteration 154 — the resident tells you what they're up to (2026-07-11) [People & activity × Interaction/UX]

**Vector.** People & activity × **Interaction/UX** (SHIPPED). Rotation named the domain (People was stalest,
last 145) and this is its *coldest* kind — only iter 71 sat in the People × Interaction/UX cell. Varied the kind
off 153's Deepen. The seam is the loop's most reliable tell (117): the Resident's `ENTINFO` sub was a flat
`'Out for a stroll.'` while `stepPed` **already** sorts peds by context — onto the pier, hugging a lively kerb,
drawn to a high-`buzz` hex — a relationship the tooltip ignored.

**Change (~20 lines, tooltip-only).** New `residentDoing(p)` reads the hex the ped stands on and returns the
phrase for it, a FUNCTION sub in the 105 style: pier → *"Out on the pier for the view."*; then by tile —
MARKET *"Browsing the market stalls."*, PARK/SHOREPARK *"Out for a walk in the green."*, GARDEN *"Pottering in
the community garden."*, PLAZA/QUAD *"Crossing the square."*, BEACH/DUNE *"Down on the sand."*, STADIUM, FIELD;
then a road → `livelyKerb` *"Window-shopping the busy street."* vs plain *"Walking the block."*; fallback
*"Out for a stroll."* Every position a ped can legally hold is `strollable` open ground or a road (`pedWalk`),
so the cases tile the field. The leashed **dog** heels to its owner's hex, so its sub echoes the owner —
*"With its owner, out for a walk in the green."* (stray falls back to *"Off to sniff everything."*). Reuses the
existing `onPier`/`cellAt`/`pedRoad`/`livelyKerb` predicates — no new state, no seeded `rng()`, no draw.

**Census.** PASS, exit 0. Tooltip-only — tile histogram empty, all core/aggregate metrics +0 (vacuous by
construction; the probe is the gate).

**Probe — `probes/probe-strolling.mjs` (new, promoted).** `residentDoing` is a PURE function of position, so the
probe enumerates EVERY cell as a hypothetical ped, buckets cells by the phrase the PAGE returns, and checks each
bucket against the RAW `cells[].t` (122's law — not by re-calling the function). Seeds 7 & 42 @ warp 61:
**every tile bucket holds ONLY its intended type** (`Down on the sand.` = {BEACH,DUNE}, `…green.` = {PARK,SHOREPARK},
etc. — zero leakage), pier bucket **all onPier** (5–6 cells), road split **all** `pedRoad` with the busy bucket
(106/118 cells) **all** `livelyKerb`. **CONTROL:** 1060+ building interiors (RES/MID/TOWER/COM/IND) → the
fallback and NOTHING else, so the mapping doesn't leak onto tiles a ped only passes. Deterministic across two
loads. **PROBE PASS both seeds.**

**Visual.** `hovershot.mjs ZOOM=4 PICK=front` on a Resident: seed 42 rendered *"Window-shopping the busy street."*,
seed 7 *"Browsing the market stalls."* — `pageerrors: none`, no mojibake (the strings are pure-ASCII per iter 134;
em dashes live only in comments). One agent read both seeds' hover PNGs: tooltip legible, cream card on-frame, no
z-order tears/blowout, scene still a coherent coastal city — **VISUAL: PASS**. Owned-dog echo verified in-page:
*"With its owner, out for a walk in the green."*

**Verdict — SHIPPED.** The peds that fill the streets now answer when you point at one: a figure on a market hex
says it's browsing the stalls, one on a shop-lined kerb is window-shopping, one on the pier is out for the view.
Tooltip-only, pop provably flat, reuses five existing predicates. People × Interaction/UX gains its second (71,
**154**); People is no longer stalest (Transport 146 now is).

### Findings for later laps
- **The mute-tooltip tell now pays for ENTITIES too, not just tiles (117 was tiles).** `stepPed`'s own context
  sorting (pier/kerb/buzz/tile) was richer than the one static string that named it — the same shape as a
  `TILEDESC` asserting less than the CA knows. **Where else does an ENTITY's step/draw logic decide something its
  `ENTINFO` sub keeps flat?** Candidates still flat: `Jogger` ('Logging shoreline miles.' — it knows its
  shoreline `y`/direction), `Cyclist`, `Streetcar`/`Delivery truck` (a route/depot membership, like 105 did for
  transit). The functional-sub (105) + shared-predicate (144) recipe applies to each.
- **A PURE position→string function is probeable by ENUMERATION, no live entity needed.** Because `residentDoing`
  reads only `p.x/p.y`, the probe swept ALL cells as hypothetical peds and audited the phrase→tile partition —
  sidestepping 137's "peds are non-reproducible across loads" entirely. Any tooltip that is a pure function of an
  entity's *cell* (not its motion phase) can be gated this way: bucket-by-phrase, check against raw `cells[].t`,
  plus a control tile-class that must hit the fallback.
- **`residentDoing(p)` is now the one definition of "what is this ped doing" (144's one-predicate law).** The dog
  echo, the tooltip and the probe all call it; a future "peds thin at night" or crowd-label vector should read it,
  not re-classify position. It maps EVERY strollable/road hex, so it is also a ready oracle for "is this ped
  somewhere interesting."

## Iteration 155 — the streetcar draws from an overhead wire (2026-07-11) [Transport × Deepen]

**Vector.** Transport × **Deepen** (SHIPPED). Rotation named the domain — Transport was the single stalest (last
146) — and 118's law + 138's findings rule out a Transport New element (entities saturated). Varied the kind off
146 (Polish) / 154 (the recent IUX run) to **Deepen**, running the loop's most reliable move in its **draw** form
(149's law): an ornament that asserts a relationship the draw ignores. The tram's comment (L5134) called its
trolley pole *"a slim trolley pole to the overhead"* — but there **was no overhead.** The pole drew from
`cy-6.6` to a lone contact dot at `(cx+1.3, cy-9.4)`, poking at empty air. Same shape as 149's frozen clock:
the streetcar claimed to be an electric rail vehicle drawing power from a catenary, and drew none.

**The seam.** `drawVehicle`'s `v.kind==='tram'` block (L5133). `A=ctr(v.x,v.y)`, `B=ctr(v.nx,v.ny)` (the A->B
segment the tram is traversing), `L`, `lane` are all in scope at the top of `drawVehicle` (L5077-5079), so the
overhead wire can be strung the length of the block at the SAME lane offset, raised a fixed height.

**Change (~8 lines, draw-only).** Replaced the leaning pole+dot with (1) a **contact wire** from `A` to `B`,
lane-shifted and raised `wh=9.6` (`ctx.moveTo(A[0]+lox,A[1]+loy-wh)…lineTo(B[0]+lox,B[1]+loy-wh)`) — because
`cx=lerp(A,B,p)-ddy/L*lane` and `cy=lerp+ddx/L*lane*0.6`, the wire point directly above the tram is exactly
`(cx,cy-wh)`, so the wire spans the ROAD (holds still as the tram slides under it), not the car; (2) a **vertical
pantograph** from the roof `(cx,cy-6.6)` straight up to `(cx,cy-wh)`; (3) the contact shoe dot at `(cx,cy-wh)`.
Kept the cream livery belt. No tile, entity, `rng()`, `hashCell`, `tick()` pass or terrain; strings pure-ASCII
(134, comment only). Pop provably flat, stream-neutral.

**Census.** PASS, exit 0, pageerrors 0. Tile histogram empty, core metrics +0 (`towerHt +1` is the documented
chaotic-CA headless wobble), entity counts identical (trams 54 · cars 360 …). Vacuous by construction — the
probe is the gate.

**Probe — `probes/probe-tramwire.mjs` (new, promoted).** Trams drift nondeterministically over the road network
between loads (137's law), so it CLEARS **every** mover (clouds/birds/balloons spawn via `Math.random` and would
put a noise floor on a whole-frame diff — see findings) and PLACES 120 trams (target) then 120 cars (control) at
spread ROAD centres, all east, frozen clock+`waveT` (109). Metric = **whole-frame** changed-pixel fraction
patched-vs-pristine-HEAD (in a frozen frame the only difference IS the wires, so no per-vehicle box / unit
juggling). seeds 7/42: **tram-set 0.21% of frame changed** vs **car control 0.004%** — a ~50x separation,
confined to the tram kind (the car draw is byte-identical). **PASS.**

**Visual.** `probes/shot-tramwire.mjs` (new) places a run of trams on a **clear avenue** (front-of-frame, open
ground/water in front so nothing occludes the overhead), camera-zooms, clips day + night. First shot placed the
trams in a **tower canyon** and an agent correctly FAILED it (front-row towers buried the trams AND the wire,
leaving pantograph nubs poking at air — see findings); the fair clear-avenue re-shoot then PASSED: a fresh agent
read the wire as *"a single thin dark wire … unbroken across the full avenue … poles rise from the tram roofs and
meet it"*, plausible catenary, no z-order tears/clipping/blowout, present day and night. Whole-city `wide` at
seeds 42 & 7, one agent each: both **VISUAL: PASS** — balanced coherent coastal cities, nothing compounded (the
wire is sub-pixel and invisible at fit zoom, so it adds no clutter there).

**Verdict — DEEPENED.** The streetcar now draws power from an overhead contact wire strung over its avenue, where
for the artifact's whole life its pole poked at empty air — it reads as an electric tram, joining the moon (135),
the clock (149) and the vineyard (148/139) in the run of ornaments that now honor what they always claimed.
Draw-only, stream-neutral, pop flat, ~8 lines. Transport's Deepen cell gains its next (28, 39, 55, 63, 112, 121,
128, **155**); Transport is no longer stalest (Nature 148 now is).

### Findings for later laps
- **THE ASSERTS-MORE-THAN-IT-SHOWS *DRAW* TELL (149) PAID AGAIN — grep vehicle/ornament COMMENTS for a claimed
  connection the geometry omits.** 149 found the frozen clock by its comment; this lap found the tram by *"pole to
  the overhead"* over an overhead that wasn't drawn. Candidates still open (149's list): the firehouse bell is
  static; museum/parliament are floodlit but otherwise inert. A pole/mast/gauge that *should* touch something is
  the richest version.
- **A LOW OVERHEAD ELEMENT IS OCCLUDED BY FRONT-ROW BUILDINGS — that is physically correct, but it means a
  tower-canyon zoom can show a bare pantograph nub.** The wire draws in the tram's bucket (after its own two
  cells' buildings, L5608) so it is correct against those, but nearer ROWS (drawn later, L5600) legitimately
  overpaint it — so in dense downtown the wire hides behind the front towers (as real catenary would) and only the
  nub pokes above. Unlike the monorail (drawn per-cell at `RAILH`, well above rooftops), the tram wire is at
  street level and inherently occludable. Accepted as realistic; a shot MUST choose a clear avenue (open ground in
  front) to judge it fairly, or it reads as broken nubs. **When shooting a low overhead detail, pick a
  front-of-frame cell with open ground/water behind and in front — never a tower canyon.**
- **A WHOLE-FRAME PATCHED-vs-HEAD DIFF NEEDS EVERY `Math.random` MOVER CLEARED, not just the seeded ones.** My
  first cut cleared vehicles/peds/etc. but left clouds/birds/balloons, which spawn via `Math.random` at load and
  differ between the two page loads — a 0.15% whole-frame noise floor that swamped the ~0.2% wire signal. Clearing
  **all** movers dropped the control to 0.004% (pure render nondeterminism) and the ~50x separation appeared. For
  any whole-frame two-load diff, clear the full entity list (the `[a,b,…].forEach(a=>a.length=0)` block), not a
  subset. (The per-box metric in `probe-buslivery` sidesteps this by only sampling the vehicle body; a whole-frame
  metric cannot.)
- **`CW` IS A WORLD UNIT; `sx/sy` FROM `__find` ARE SCREEN px — do not mix them in a getImageData box.** My first
  probe built the sample box as `0.7*CW*dpr` wide (world) but `(sy-12)…(sy-6.5)` tall (screen), so the box was the
  wrong size and read ~0 signal. The whole-frame diff dodges the unit problem entirely and is the more robust
  shape for a thin draw-only ornament whose exact pixels are hard to box.

## Iteration 156 — the woods flower in spring (2026-07-11) [Nature × New element]

**Vector.** Nature & landscape × **New element** (SHIPPED). Rotation named the domain — Nature was the single
stalest (last 148) — and 155's entry passed it the baton. Kind: varied off Nature's worn Deepen (139/120/108)
and its now-spent agriculture Interaction/UX (148); **New element** is Nature's stalest kind (last **102**) and
fresh. Content followed **127's law** (saturation is of a domain's *entities*, not its *surfaces*): FOREST is a
large untouched surface — **69 hexes/city** vs GARDEN's 2 and MEADOW's 2-6 — and its floor drew nothing but
`grassDk` + scrub. Meanwhile the MEADOW's lovely wildflower-bloom aesthetic (specks + butterflies, iter 49) is
stranded on those 2-6 tiles where nobody sees it. So: a spring wildflower understory on the woodland floor —
botanically the ephemerals that bloom in the brief window after the thaw and **before the canopy closes over
them** (the same `s≈0.28` spring the palette already greens the canopy on).

**The seam.** `case T.FOREST` (L3331) drew the floor as one `grassDk` fill; `applySeason` (L314) already computes
a `spring` factor from `year` but only fed it to the canopy palette. I added a shared `springBloom()` (L1113,
next to `orchardPhase`/`vinePhase`) = `clamp(1-|s-0.28|/0.17,0,1)` — ONE predicate the draw and the tooltip both
read (112's law), so the flowers cannot claim a season the floor doesn't paint.

**Change (~10-line draw + 1-line tooltip + 1 helper, all draw-only).** In the FOREST draw, right after the base
hexTile and **before** the trees (so the canopy overlays the floor), a `springBloom()>0.06`-gated block scatters
3-5 wildflower specks per hex — `hashCell(x,y,seedNum^SALT)` for count and positions (spaced salts 0x5B/0x5C/0x5D),
colors `lav`/`gold`/`white` (static, not season-touched, so they keep their hue), alpha `0.30+0.55·spf`. A
matching `describeTile` row (`['Understory','Spring wildflowers']` when `springBloom()>0.4`) keeps the tooltip in
sync. No tile, entity, `rng()`, `tick()` pass or terrain; strings pure-ASCII (134). Fully stream-neutral (hashCell
only) and pop-neutral.

**Census.** PASS, exit 0, pageerrors 0. Tile histogram empty, all core metrics +0 (`pop +4` is documented
chaotic-CA headless wobble), entity counts identical. Vacuous by construction — the probe is the gate.

**Probe — `probes/probe-woodbloom.mjs` (new, promoted).** Isolates the flowers from the canopy's OWN seasonal
palette shift by diffing **patched vs pristine HEAD at the SAME frozen spring frame** — the only difference
between the two builds is the wildflower block (per-pixel changed fraction, |ΔRGB|>18, over each FOREST hex's 7×7
box). Clears EVERY mover first (tramwire's law — else Math.random cars/peds drift over the ROAD control between
loads). seeds 7/42: **FOREST changed 10.95% / 11.30% in SPRING → 0.00% / 0.00% in SUMMER** (spf=0, byte-identical),
**ROAD control 0.04-0.16%** both frames. So the understory appears only in spring and only on forest — a ~55×
separation within the one tile type, and zero leakage onto roads.

**Visual.** `probes/shot-woodbloom.mjs` (new) camera-zooms a dense forest patch, clipping spring vs summer; plus
whole-city `wide` at seeds 42 & 7 (spring). Three agents, one each, discriminate-don't-judge (108). Zoom agent:
SPRING has the lavender/gold/white specks on the forest floor between/under the trees (not floating, not bleeding
onto the neighbouring meadow hex), SUMMER floor plain — **VISUAL: PASS**. Both whole-city agents: balanced
coherent coastal city, no z-order tears/floaters/blowout, forest/green reads as calm sage/olive with **no** speckle
or noise at fit zoom (the understory is correctly sub-pixel there) — **VISUAL: PASS** both.

**Verdict — SHIPPED.** The woods now flower in spring — a wildflower understory carpets the forest floor before
the canopy closes and fades by summer, lifting a 69-hex surface that drew nothing but a green fill, and finally
giving the MEADOW's stranded bloom aesthetic a stage the whole city can see. Draw-only, stream + pop neutral, one
shared predicate. Nature's New element cell gains its next (4, 26, 29, 102, **156**); Nature is no longer stalest
(Civic 149 now is).

### Findings for later laps
- **127'S "SURFACE, NOT ENTITIES" LAW PAYS AGAIN — pick the domain's BIGGEST tile count for a New element.** The
  census tile histogram is the map: seed 42 forest=69, park=205, but garden=2, meadow=2-6. A within-hex ornament
  buys pixels in proportion to the tile's COUNT, so a New element aimed at a 2-tile type (GARDEN, which the header
  kept banking) is nearly invisible whatever you draw; the same effort on FOREST (69) lights the whole woodland.
  **Read the histogram before choosing which surface to decorate.**
- **A SEASON-GATED DRAW IS PROBED patched-vs-pristine AT ONE FROZEN SEASON, not season-vs-season.** The confound is
  that the base palette ALSO shifts with season (the canopy greens/golds), so a plain spring-vs-summer FOREST diff
  moves even with no flowers. Diffing the two BUILDS at the same spring frame cancels the palette shift entirely —
  the only difference is your block. The summer patched-vs-pristine diff (=0) is then the clean confinement control,
  and it's stronger than ROAD because it's the SAME tile type proving your gate is off out of season.
- **`springBloom()` JOINS `orchardPhase`/`vinePhase` AS A SHARED YEAR-PREDICATE — reuse it, don't re-clamp.**
  Anything else that should key on the spring window (a future MEADOW green-up, blossom drifts, spring bird return)
  should read it, so the draw and any tooltip cannot drift. It reads the FAST `year` (development clock), which is
  fine for a CONTINUOUS alpha (drift tolerated, like `applySeason`), but a DISCRETE spring/not-spring readout off it
  would strobe (134) — quantize or slow-clock first, exactly as the banked SEASON word still needs.

## Iteration 157 — the eleventh step-back finds a clean city, perf flat (2026-07-11) [holistic step-back]

**Vector.** The mandated holistic step-back (105/110/115/120/125/130/136/142/147/152/**157**). Not a domain × kind
lap: it reads the WHOLE city for *cumulative* drift the census and per-feature gates are blind to, runs the season
probe + interleaved perf gate, at night AND a season with the day/night baselines pinned OFF January
(`year=2035.62` dry peak; `2035.02` as the seasonal-contrast frame). No city vector taken, so rotation is
unchanged — the next lap (158) owes the stalest domain, **Civic (149)**, then Water (150).

**What was read.** Un-zoomed whole-city `wide` frames at **2 seeds × 3 lights/calendars** — seed 42 (warp 61) &
seed 7 (warp 31), each at {day 2035.62/t=0.35, night 2035.62/t=0.90, winter 2035.02/t=0.35}. One subagent per
seed read its own three frames: the cumulative question ("has anything compounded into clutter or darkness?")
plus 108's **locate-don't-judge** night test ("where is the core by light alone?").

**Result: the city is healthy — both agents VISUAL: PASS.**
- **Night core (115/143) LOCATED off-centre both seeds** — seed 42 ~(0.48,0.52), seed 7 ~(0.48,0.60) — matching
  152 ((.47,.55)/(.44,.62)), 147 and 142, each with a genuine core→edge falloff to a dark rim, not a flat wash.
  Both agents also named a secondary lit lobe (42 ~(.42,.38), 7 ~(.42,.48)) — the old-town crossroads reading
  distinct from the CBD, as intended.
- **138's arterial night-corridors** read as *continuous* warm ribbons distinct from dim side streets both seeds;
  the sea reads (116's bottom + 123's founded wind farm). **No z-order tears / floaters / hard seams /
  blown-out white** in any of the 6 frames. **Winter reads distinct** from summer (farm/scrub tan/dormant, cooler
  flatter light, cooler ocean) at both seeds — the mildest of the three deltas, by-design (120's dilution).

**Season — measured alive.** `probes/probe-season.mjs`: FARM winter→dry-peak **88.4** (matches 130/136/142/147/152),
VINEYARD 44.6/36.7/42.7 (139), **FOREST now 20.6/19.7/24.6** (156's spring understory + canopy shift both read),
ORCHARD/MEADOW/SHOREPARK all move, PARK/REDWOOD/GARDEN/QUAD near-zero by design (120), ROAD control **0.5–2.2**.
Calendar working; the whole-frame mildness is the by-design evergreen/irrigated dilution.

**Perf — 152→156 cost ZERO; the stored-baseline read fired its SIXTH+ false-FAIL.** `perf.mjs` vs stored baseline
read day **+30%** / night **+39%**, looking like a regression. Interleaved HEAD-156 vs the iter-152 file
(`be84b49`, A/B/A/B, **min per variant**): day **37.66 vs 36.39** (**+3.5%**, inside the ±9ms round-to-round noise
floor the day column swung across — 43.2/37.7 for the same HEAD bytes) and night **42.83 vs 42.66** (**+0.4%,
flat**). So 153 (per-star magnitude, night-only draw) + 154 (tooltip-only) + 155 (tram catenary, day+night stroke)
+ 156 (spring understory, OFF at the perf frame's ~January year) added nothing measurable. NOT re-pinned. Census
PASS, vacuous (no source edit); tree verified clean after the interleave restored HEAD.

**Change (the step-back's product — none to the city).** No compounding defect, so per 120/130/136/142/147/152 ("a
clean step-back is a complete iteration — don't force a filler vector") the output is the health record + header
refreshes: step-back pointer 152→157 (next 162), the sixth clean bill, and the 157 interleaved perf reading. No
`solvista.html` edit.

**Verdict — FIXED.** No compounding city defect — the SIXTH clean step-back in a row (130, 136, 142, 147, 152,
157). All accumulated visual laws (115/116/120/123 + 138 arterials + 143 CBD peak) still read at both seeds under
all three lights; the season is alive (156's understory now shows in the FOREST column); perf is flat against the
honest interleaved control.

### Findings
- **SIXTH CONSECUTIVE CLEAN STEP-BACK, and the stored-baseline false-FAIL is now habitual — trust ONLY the
  interleave.** The stored baseline (day 33.16 / night 37.33, pinned 2026-07-10) read +30% day / +39% night on a
  diff the interleave proves free; the 5-day-old iter-152 file reads the same inflated numbers today. Re-pin only
  if an interleave *itself* shows a persistent offset (it has not since 142's real +2.2%).
- **THE DAY COLUMN IS NOISIER THAN NIGHT ON THIS BOX — grade day only by the min-of-≥2-rounds interleave.** Round 1
  read the identical HEAD bytes at 43.2ms day and round 2 at 37.7ms (a 15% swing from load alone), so a single-round
  day delta is meaningless; night was steady (42.8/42.9). Take at least two rounds and the min per variant, exactly
  as the skill says — a one-round day number will invent a regression or hide one.
- **156's spring understory correctly reads ZERO perf at the standard perf frame** (year 2035 ≈ January, bloom
  gate off) yet MOVES the season probe's FOREST column (spring 20.6) — the two gates see it at different calendars,
  which is the intended design (season-gated draws are free out of season). Don't read "perf flat" as "the feature
  isn't drawing"; read the probe at the season the gate is on.

## Iteration 158 — the observatory dome opens and turns with the night sky (2026-07-11) [Civic & culture × Deepen]

**Vector.** Civic & culture × **Deepen** (SHIPPED). Rotation named the domain — after the 157 step-back the lap
owed the stalest domain, **Civic** (last SHIP 149). Kind stayed Deepen (149's own cell) because 149 explicitly
*banked* the seam: the asserts-more-than-it-shows tell has a **draw** form, and 149's richest banked candidate was
*"a frozen sundial/gauge/vane that should track a clock."* The observatory is exactly that — and it feeds Sky by
deepening Civic toward it (108's law, "Sky can be fed by deepening another domain"). A banked, named finding
outranks kind-rotation (the header's own law), so Deepen it is; content varies from 149 (a clock hand) and 155/153
(tram/stars).

**The seam.** `case 'observatory'` (L4650) drew the teal dome with a **slit at a FIXED azimuth** — `sd` (a per-city
hashCell) flipped which side it sat, but it never moved through the night — while its own `CIVICDESC` promised
*"A dome out on the dark rim of the city, open to the night."* A real observatory dome **rotates** to keep a target
in the aperture and is buttoned up by day. The observatory is one-per-city, sited from 2018 (present in the 2035
census slices) — a zoom-reward landmark like the hall clock (149), not dead code (census tile histogram confirms 1/city).

**Change (~13 lines, draw-only).** Replaced the static slit with an aperture whose azimuth reads the slow day clock
(`dayT`, the same one the hall clock (149) and moon (135) read): `nd = dayT>0.5?dayT-1:dayT` (signed offset from
midnight), `phi = clamp(nd*4.887,-1.4,1.4)*openAmt*sd`. So the slit points at the **zenith (straight up) at midnight**
and leans toward the east/west horizons through dusk and dawn — and at midnight it looks UP while the 149 clock hand
points DOWN, complementary readers of one clock. `openAmt = clamp((LITAMT-0.15)/0.45,0,1)` gates the aperture
open after dark and shut by day (thin seam → wide bright glowing slit); the instrument glow rides the open slit.
`sd` kept as per-city handedness. No tile, entity, `rng()`, `hashCell` spawn, `tick()` pass or terrain; strings
pure-ASCII (134). Stream + pop provably flat. Added a test-only `__obs()` locator hook (dome center/radius on
screen + `sd`/`openAmt`/`phi`), mirroring `__clock` (149).

**Census.** PASS, exit 0, pageerrors 0. Tile histogram empty, all core metrics +0, entity counts identical
(`greenRoofs +1` is documented chaotic-CA wobble). Vacuous by construction (a draw reading globals) — the probe is
the gate.

**Probe — `probes/probe-obsdome.mjs` (new, promoted).** Zooms the camera onto the dome (149: camera-set beats
wheel) and measures the aperture from pixels, locate-don't-judge (108); recomputes the expected sweep itself, never
gates on `__obs().phi`. Two measurements: **azimuth** = centroid of near-white slit ink (L>235 — clean at night,
when the dome is dark); **open/shut** = local contrast `p95−median` in the aperture band (lighting-robust, unlike
absolute luminance which daylight confounds — my first cut read noon "brighter" than midnight). seeds 7/42/1234/3/88,
all with an observatory: at 5 night dayT the slit azimuth sweeps **monotonic** and **midnight sits at the zenith
(−1°)** — seed 42 (sd=1) −39°→−20°→−1°→+8°→+12°, seed 3 (sd=−1) mirrors it +38°→…→−13°; aperture **open at midnight
(contrast 156) vs shut at noon (70)**; control (a night frame twice) pixel-identical. **VERDICT: PASS (5 seeds).**

**Visual.** `probes/shot-obsdome.mjs` (new) camera-zooms the dome at dusk/midnight/dawn/noon, 2 seeds. One agent,
blind locate (108): midnight slit **UP** both seeds; dusk vs dawn lean to **opposite sides** (mirrored between seeds
by `sd`, as designed); noon aperture a faint shut sliver vs the vivid midnight glow; dome seated on its drum, proper
z-order (a front tower correctly occludes) — **VISUAL: PASS**. Whole-city `wide` night (seed 42) + day (seed 7),
one agent each: both balanced coherent coast, lit core → dark rim, no tears/floaters/blowout, nothing compounded —
**VISUAL: PASS** both.

**Verdict — DEEPENED.** The observatory dome now opens after dark and rotates to track the night sky, where for the
artifact's whole life its slit sat frozen — finally honoring the `CIVICDESC` that always called it "open to the
night." Draw-only, stream + pop flat, ~13 lines + a locator hook + a probe + a shot script. Civic's Deepen cell
gains its next (36, 59, 66, 80, 91, 149, **158**); Civic is no longer stalest (Water 150 now is).

### Findings for later laps
- **149'S DRAW-TELL PAYS AGAIN — its banked candidate list is a to-do list.** 149 named the seam ("a frozen
  vane/gauge/dome that should track a clock") AND named the candidates; 158 just cashed the richest one. Still
  banked from 149: the **firehouse bell** (static gold disc — but no natural clock tie, weaker) and the
  **museum/parliament** floodlights. The observatory was the strongest because its own tooltip already asserted the
  behavior ("open to the night"). Where else does a DRAWN ornament's comment/shape promise motion the draw ignores?
- **OPEN/SHUT IS MEASURED BY LOCAL CONTRAST (peak−median), NOT ABSOLUTE LUMINANCE — daylight confounds the latter.**
  My first probe counted pixels over a fixed luminance threshold and read NOON as *more* open than midnight, because
  the whole daylit dome exceeds the threshold. The fix: within the aperture band, `p95−median` — a bright slit on a
  dark night dome gives high contrast; a shut seam on a uniformly-lit day dome gives low contrast — regardless of
  ambient light. Absolute-threshold centroid is still fine for the AZIMUTH *at night* (dome dark, only the slit is
  near-white). Two metrics, two lighting regimes: contrast for open/shut across day↔night, luminance-centroid for
  direction within the night.
- **A SWEEP THAT PIVOTS ON `dayT>0.5?dayT-1:dayT` IS SYMMETRIC IN CODE BUT NOT IN THE OPEN WINDOW.** The aperture is
  full-open by dusk (dayT 0.90 → openAmt 1.0) but drops fast on the dawn side (dayT 0.10 → 0.21), so a naive
  symmetric ±0.10 night sample set put one frame outside the open window (ink=0). Pick night probe samples by
  checking `openAmt`, not by assuming the dusk/dawn edges are mirror images — the daylight model isn't.

## Iteration 159 — the surf glows at night (2026-07-11) [Water & coast × Deepen]

**Vector.** Water & coast × **Deepen** (SHIPPED). Rotation named the domain — after the 158 Civic ship the lap
owed the stalest domain, **Water** (last SHIP 150). Kind varied off Water's worn Polish (150/132/116) and its
recent IUX (141) to **Deepen**, enriching the existing surf-break draw with a genuinely new night phenomenon —
and, like 135 (moon) / 153 (stars) / 158 (observatory), feeding the night-mood theme by deepening a domain toward
Sky (108's law). Content: **bioluminescence** — the breaking surf phosphoresces a cool sea-green after dark, the
Water counterpart to the run of night features the last laps built.

**The seam.** `case T.WATER`'s surf-break block (L3126) already strokes foam along every beach-facing hex edge with
a traveling opacity wave `ph=sin(waveT*1.6-(y+dy*0.5)*0.9)` and an inset `ins`. Its per-edge vertices `a`/`b`,
inset direction `ix`/`iy`, and `ph` are all in scope — the exact host for a night glow that breaks where the wave
breaks.

**Change (~18 lines, draw-only).** A `LITAMT>0.5`-gated block after each foam stroke scatters up to 3 **soft
glowing dots** along the break, each `hashCell(...,seedNum^0x0B10)`-gated (skip if `hb<0.45`) so most slots are
empty and the glow reads as **sparse sparks, not a line**. Each dot: a wide faint halo arc + a small bright centre,
both a **deep saturated sea-green** raw literal (`rgba(66,220,164)` / `rgba(110,238,188)` — emitted light, so
untinted by the blue night TINT, like the warm city-light smear above; low red channel so overlaps stay green, not
white). Strength = `dphi·(LITAMT-0.5)/0.5·(0.55+0.45·hb)`. No tile, entity, `rng()`, `tick()` pass or terrain;
strings pure-ASCII (134). Stream + pop provably flat.

**Census.** PASS, exit 0, pageerrors 0. Tile histogram empty, core metrics +0, entity counts identical. Vacuous
by construction (a night-only draw at the day census frame draws nothing) — the probe is the gate.

**Probe — `probes/probe-biolum.mjs` (new, promoted).** Diffs PATCHED vs pristine HEAD at the SAME frozen frame
(waveT pinned to 12.3, every mover cleared per tramwire's law), sampling the water hexes that touch a beach hex
(the surf hosts, found in-page) with ROAD as the zero control. seeds 7/42: **SURF changed 0.24% / 0.51% at NIGHT →
0.00% / 0.00% in DAY** (gate off → byte-identical), **ROAD control ~0** both frames. So the glow appears only at
night and only on the surf line. **PASS.**

**Visual.** `probes/shot-biolum.mjs` (new; takes seed/warp/**scale**) camera-zooms a front-of-frame beach that
touches open water, clipping night + a day control. **This vector cost SIX tuning rounds** — see findings; the
short version is that a per-edge *stroke* reads as a continuous neon tube on straight coasts however dim, and a
pale aqua blows to near-white where adjacent hexes' strokes stack. The design that finally passed is **scattered
soft DOTS in a deep sea-green**. At a moderate ~4.3x zoom (the scale a user actually looks at the coast) both seeds
read as soft, tasteful, patchy phosphorescence on the waterline, no blowout: seed 42 & seed 7 one agent each,
both **VISUAL: PASS**. Whole-city `wide` night (seed 42): balanced coherent coast, lit core → dark rim, the sparks
correctly sub-pixel/no clutter at fit zoom, no tears/floaters/blowout — **VISUAL: PASS**.

**Verdict — DEEPENED.** The breaking surf now sparkles with bioluminescence after dark, a new night life for the
coastline that for the artifact's whole life went dark at the waterline — the Water entry in the run of night
features (moon 135, stars 153, observatory 158). Draw-only, stream + pop flat. Water's Deepen cell gains its next
(17, 25, 51, 65, 72, 113, 123, **159**); Water is no longer stalest (Urban 151 now is).

### Findings for later laps
- **A GLOWING LINE ALONG A HEX EDGE READS AS A NEON TUBE; A GLOWING DOT READS AS A SPARK. For a night ornament on
  the faceted coast, draw DOTS not strokes.** Four straight agent reads FAILed the stroke forms ("uniform neon tube
  tracing the hex edges", "blown-out near-white cores") across every brightness and patchiness I tried; switching
  to sparse hash-gated dots passed both seeds on the first try. A per-edge stroke on a straight coast joins with its
  neighbours into a continuous bright outline that exposes the hex geometry — no alpha low enough to fix it stays
  visible. Dots can't form a line, so they never trace the geometry. **When a per-edge draw keeps reading as an
  outline, stop tuning its brightness and change its SHAPE to points.**
- **EMITTED LIGHT THAT STACKS MUST HAVE A LOW RED CHANNEL, OR IT BLOWS TO WHITE.** A pale aqua (`rgba(178,255,228)`,
  R=178) over dark water goes near-white where two strokes overlap (additive coverage → the light stroke colour). A
  deep sea-green (R=66) stays green at any coverage because the red channel never climbs. For any additive glow that
  can overlap itself (coast corners, dense edges), pick the colour by its **darkest** channel, not its hue.
- **THE "GOOD WINDOW" OF A SUBTLE COAST DETAIL IS A MODERATE ZOOM, NOT FIT AND NOT EXTREME.** At fit zoom the glow is
  correctly invisible (adds nothing, clutters nothing — whole-city PASS); at a punishing 7x the closest corner hexes
  stack into bright bars; at ~4x (the natural "look at the coast" zoom) it reads as intended. Judge a coast ornament
  at the zoom a user would actually use to see the coast — `shot-biolum.mjs` now takes a `scale` arg for exactly
  this. A 7x FAIL on a feature that's clean at fit and lovely at 4x is the zoom being unfair, not the feature.
- **`probe-biolum` re-confirms tramwire's law and adds one:** clear EVERY mover before a whole-frame two-load diff,
  AND if you dim a feature to fix a look, re-run the probe — a deep-green + low-alpha pass dropped seed 7's night
  signal to 0.05% (below its own ROAD noise) before I raised it back; a look-fix can silently kill the measurement.
